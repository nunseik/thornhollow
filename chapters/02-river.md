# Chapter 2: The River

Theron half-slid, half-scrambled down the ravine, loose stones skittering beneath his feet, sharp edges cutting through his worn boots. His hands scraped against rough stone, finding purchase where they could. The moonlight caught the water below: black and swift, cutting through the forest like a silver knife. Even from here, he could hear the roar of it, feel the spray misting his face.

"Can you swim?" Whisper asked, claws tightening.

"Can *you*?"

"I'm a rat. We're *excellent* swimmers. It's the cold I'm worried about."

Theron's thumb traced its familiar pattern across his fingers—index to pinky, thinking, calculating. The water would mask their scent. It was the right choice.

He hit the water and gasped—the cold was a physical shock, stealing his breath, stopping his heart for a terrifying moment. *Freezing* didn't capture it. This was snowmelt from the northern peaks, so cold it burned. His muscles seized. His lungs refused to work. For a moment, he thought he'd made a fatal mistake.

Then his body remembered how to breathe. How to move.

He found his footing on the rocky riverbed, stones slippery beneath his boots, the current tugging at his robes with surprising strength. The water was waist-deep here, chest-deep there as the river dipped and flowed. He pushed off, letting the flow carry him downstream, keeping his head low. His robes dragged at him, heavy with water. His teeth chattered uncontrollably. Whisper clung to his collar, tiny claws digging in desperately, nose just above the waterline, whiskers twitching with displeasure but no complaint.

Behind them, through the rush of water in his ears, the thralls' cries grew distant. Confused. They were chasing his phantom deeper into the forest, away from the water.

## Rest and Recovery

The river bent. Through the thinning canopy, he spotted it: the old road, a pale ribbon of packed earth running parallel to the water. And beyond—distant lights, warm and yellow. A village? A waystation? Hope, small but real.

Theron dragged himself onto the muddy bank, every muscle screaming in protest. His hands were numb, fumbling against the slick mud. He collapsed onto solid ground, shivering so violently his vision blurred. Water poured from his robes. His fingers were white, wrinkled, completely without feeling. His lips had gone numb. When he tried to stand, his legs barely held him. His hand automatically reached for his component pouch—and found nothing but empty belt. Right. The witch had it. He clenched his numb fist, feeling nothing.

Whisper shook himself dry with offended dignity, water spraying from his fur in droplets that caught the moonlight.

"Well, wizard. We're alive." The familiar surveyed the road, then him, whiskers dripping. "What's the plan? Rest and recover? Or push on through the night?"

The witch wouldn't stop hunting. But he was cold—*dangerously* cold, the kind that made thinking difficult—spent, and magically depleted. His hands trembled uncontrollably. He could barely stand.

Theron's thumb traced across his fingertips—index to pinky—calculating. Push through exhausted, or rest and risk being tracked?

"Whisper," he said through chattering teeth, already fumbling with the clasps of his sodden robes, "I need food. Anything."

The familiar fixed him with an unreadable look. "I'm your *familiar* now, not your servant."

A pause.

"...But I suppose if you die of hunger, our contract becomes rather meaningless."

He vanished into the undergrowth.

---

Theron found a hollow beneath an ancient oak—roots gnarled overhead like protective fingers, thick enough to block the wind and hide a small fire if he dared one. He didn't. Not tonight. Too risky.

He stripped down with numb fingers, his movements clumsy and slow. The wet fabric clung to his skin, resisting. He hung his robes over a low branch, wringing what water he could from the heavy fabric—it poured out in streams, soaking into the earth. The night air bit at his bare skin, raising goosebumps, but anything was better than wet cloth. He found dry leaves and moss to pile beneath the oak's shelter—the crackling leaves loud in the night silence, the moss slightly damp but better than nothing. He burrowed into the pile like an animal, pulling leaves over himself. Not warm, but warmer than the river. The earth smelled of rot and growing things.

As he worked, fragments of incantations slipped from his lips—half-remembered phrases from spells he could no longer cast. "*Lux... illuminare... protegere...*" The words felt hollow without his spellbook, without components. Just empty sounds, breath misting in the cold air. His teeth chattered between words.

Passable. He wouldn't freeze. Probably. His body heat was already warming the leaf-pile slightly. Small comfort.

---

Twenty minutes later, Whisper returned. He dropped his offering at Theron's feet with obvious pride:

Three acorns. A handful of wild blackberries, only slightly crushed, staining the rat's paws purple. And—improbably—half a bread roll, tooth-marked but edible.

"Found a traveler's dropped satchel upstream," he explained, whiskers twitching with satisfaction. "The bread was *already* bitten. Mostly."

Theron ate with shaking hands. The acorns were bitter, the blackberries tart and slightly fermented, the bread stale and crushed. It was the best meal he'd ever tasted. His stomach cramped around the food, desperate and grateful.

---

*He drifted into fitful sleep, curled beneath the oak, his familiar keeping watch with ancient, patient eyes.*

Morning would bring the road. The village. And decisions about what came next.

*The witch was still out there. She had his spellbook. His component pouch. And now, a grudge.*

---

**Dawn broke cold and grey.**

Theron woke stiff, every joint protesting, muscles aching from the river and the cold ground. Hungry again—the meager meal long burned through—but alive. His robes were damp but wearable, smelling of river water and mold. He sat up, leaves cascading off his shoulders, and his thumb began its automatic dance—index to pinky, index to pinky—as he considered the day ahead. His hand drifted to where his component pouch should hang. Empty. Always empty now. The absence was a constant ache.

Whisper sat on a root nearby, grooming his whiskers.

"The village is perhaps an hour's walk," he said. "I scouted ahead. It's small—tavern, smithy, chapel, a few farms. Nothing special." He paused. "There's also a notice board outside the tavern. Someone's posted a bounty."

His eyes glittered.

"For a *witch*."

## The Road to Millhaven

Theron pulled on his still-damp robes with a grimace—the fabric cold and clammy against his skin, making him shiver all over again—and set off toward the village, Whisper nestled in his hood, warm weight against his neck. The road was quiet—just birdsong and the distant lowing of cattle. His boots squelched with every step, still wet from the river. The morning air was crisp, smelling of dew and distant woodsmoke.

An hour later, legs aching, he crested a small hill and saw it: **Millhaven**. A humble cluster of thatched roofs and chimney smoke rising into the grey sky, exactly as Whisper had described. The sight made something in his chest loosen. Civilization. Warmth. Food. The tavern sat at the village's heart, a weathered sign creaking in the morning breeze.

*The Drowned Crow.*

Charming.

## The Tavern

Theron pushed through the door, the hinges creaking. Warmth washed over him like a blessing—blessed, wonderful warmth from a crackling hearth, making his cold-stiffened face tingle. The smell hit him next: bacon sizzling, fresh bread just out of the oven, yeasty and warm, the sharp tang of ale. His stomach cramped with sudden, desperate hunger. The murmur of early morning conversation was a comfort after the lonely night in the forest. A few heads turned: a farmer nursing an ale, two cloaked figures hunched over a map in the corner, a barmaid wiping down tables with rhythmic efficiency.

Behind the bar, a heavyset woman with kind eyes and flour-dusted arms looked him over, taking in his damp robes, disheveled appearance, and hollow-eyed exhaustion. Her expression softened.

"Rough night, traveler?"

"You could say that." His voice came out hoarse, throat raw from the cold river.

She grunted knowingly and slid a wooden menu across the bar, the wood worn smooth by countless hands.

**Breakfast at The Drowned Crow**

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Bacon, eggs, and black bread | 5 copper |
| Porridge with honey | 2 copper |
| Ale (morning strength) | 1 copper |
| Hot cider | 2 copper |

---

Theron checked his pockets. In the chaos of escape, he still had his coin purse—**14 copper and 3 silver**. The witch wanted his blood, not his money.

*He slid five copper and one more across the bar.*

"Bacon, eggs, black bread. And an ale."

The barkeep nodded approvingly. "A proper breakfast. Find a seat—Marta will bring it out."

He chose a table near the hearth, positioning himself with his back to the wall and a clear view of the room. Whisper slipped from his hood and disappeared beneath the table, invisible to casual observers.

"The two in the corner," the familiar whispered from below. "They smell like steel and old blood. Professionals."

---

The food arrived on a wooden platter, steam rising from the eggs, bacon crackling-hot and fragrant. Theron ate slowly despite his hunger, savoring every bite—the salt and fat of the bacon, crispy at the edges; the richness of the yolk, breaking golden over the bread; the dark, hearty chew of the bread itself, slightly burnt crust and soft inside. The ale was weak but welcome, cool and yeasty, washing away the last chill of the river and the taste of old fear.

The meal restored him. Warmth spread through his limbs. The fog of exhaustion lifted, replaced by clear-headed awareness. Between bites, his thumb traced its pattern across his fingers, thinking through his options. No spellbook. No components. But perhaps... allies?

As he ate, he observed.

**The cloaked figures:**

One was a woman, mid-thirties by Theron's estimate. Her silver hair was pulled back in a tight warrior's braid—prematurely gray, he suspected, given her age. Sharp gray-blue eyes tracked movement in the room with a soldier's constant assessment—door, windows, exits, the barmaid's knife belt, back to the door. A prominent scar ran from her left temple down to her jaw, cutting through what had once been a striking face. She wore practical leather armor beneath a dark traveling cloak, and her hands—visible as she traced routes on the map—showed the calluses and scars of someone who'd spent years with a sword.

As she spoke, her fingers found a silver locket at her throat, thumb pressing against its surface. Stressed about something. Her free hand adjusted the sword at her hip, checking the draw, then she rolled her shoulders—once, twice—settling tension that never quite left.

The other was a man around forty, built like a siege tower—broad-shouldered and heavy with the kind of muscle that came from labor, not vanity. His head was clean-shaven, practical for combat. Dark skin, close-cropped beard going gray at the edges, and watchful dark eyes that absorbed everything while revealing nothing. A heavy crossbow leaned against the wall beside him, positioned within easy reach. When he shifted, moving with surprising quiet for his size, Theron caught a glimpse of an old scar on his neck just above his collar.

His chair was positioned at an angle—not beside the woman, but slightly behind and to her left. Protecting her back. Deliberate. His thick fingers rested on the crossbow's tension mechanism: *click-click-click*, a rhythmic, unconscious testing. He listened more than he spoke, but his silence felt deliberate, not empty.

Their conversation was low, but he caught fragments:

*"...Thornhollow's been active again..."*

*"...the bounty's good but the last crew never came back..."*

*"...need better intel before we move..."*

The man went utterly still, head tilted slightly. Listening. Not to the conversation—to something else. The room. The sounds beyond the walls. Then, satisfied, he resumed that rhythmic clicking of the crossbow mechanism.

The woman glanced up. Her eyes met his for a half-second—assessing, calculating—then returned to the map.

Whisper's voice floated up. "They're discussing *her*. The witch."

Theron's pulse quickened. These could be allies. Or competition. Or worse—bounty hunters who might see him as leverage.

*Careful. Trust is a luxury you can't afford yet.*

Still, they were planning something against the witch. And he needed allies—someone who knew the terrain, who had resources.

Someone who might help him get his spellbook back.
