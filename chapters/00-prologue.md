# Prologue

The standing stones rose from the forest floor like broken teeth, moss-covered and ancient. Theron Ashborne approached cautiously, one hand on his component pouch, the other holding a worn piece of parchment—a map he'd sketched based on the hunter's directions. The forest smelled of damp earth and rotting leaves, the air cool against his face despite the afternoon sun filtering through the canopy above. His boots squelched softly in the mud.

He was a man in his early forties, lean in the way scholars became from too much travel and too little sleep. Brown hair showed gray at the temples from eight years of searching. His dark blue robes were travel-worn and practical, marked with the inevitable stains of a wizard's work: component dust, potion splashes, the faint scorch marks of magical accidents. His hands bore the telltale signs of his craft: calloused fingertips from years of precise component work, faint burn scars webbing across his palms.

*Five stones in a star pattern.* That's what the old hunter had said. "The threshold, they call it. The boy asked about it eight years back, then headed into those woods. Fool..."

The formation matched his description perfectly. This was where the trail went cold. This was Lucian's last known location.

Theron circled the formation slowly, studying the ground for... what? Signs of a struggle? A message carved in stone? After eight years, what did he expect to find?

Nothing. Just moss. Just shadows. Just—

*Eight years of dead ends. He'd grown careless.*

His foot crossed between two of the stones.

The air *changed*. A prickling sensation, like walking through spider silk. The hairs on his arms stood up.

*A ward.* Too late, he recognized the tingle of boundary magic.

Movement in the trees. He spun, hand going to his component pouch.

Figures emerged from the shadows—six, maybe seven. Human-shaped but *wrong*. Jerking movements. Empty eyes reflecting torchlight that shouldn't be there. Their clothes were rotted, their skin grey. The smell hit him—decay, like meat left too long in summer heat. Sweet and putrid.

*Thralls.* His blood went cold.

"You shouldn't have come here, wizard." The voice came from behind him. Male. Rough. Cultist robes, marked with symbols he didn't recognize. Three more stepped from the trees. "The mistress doesn't like trespassers."

Theron raised his hands, trying to appear non-threatening. "I'm not trespassing. I'm looking for someone. My son disappeared near here—"

"They all say that." The cultist's smile was cold. "Doesn't matter. You crossed the threshold. You're marked now. She'll want to see what you know."

"She who?" Theron's heart hammered.

The thralls moved.

No warning. No hesitation. Just sudden, horrifying speed.

Theron managed one spell—*Firebolt*, catching the nearest thrall in the chest—before cold hands grabbed him from behind. Fingers like iron dug into his arms. He tried to twist free, to pull power for another casting, but there were too many. Something struck the back of his head—sharp, brutal pain exploding across his skull.

The world tilted. His knees hit the ground hard, jarring his teeth. The taste of copper filled his mouth. Forest debris scraped against his cheek as he fell.

Through swimming vision, he saw the cultists approach. One knelt, rifling through his pockets. The cultist's breath reeked of stale wine and rotten teeth.

"Spellbook. Pouch. Take them." The cultist pulled out the folded map, squinting at Theron's notes. "Searching for someone, were you? How... *convenient*." A cold smile. "The mistress will want to know what brought you here."

"Wait—" Theron tried to speak, but his tongue wouldn't work. The world was going dark. "My son..."

## Three Days Later

*The torchlight flickered against the damp stone walls of the cell. Theron Ashborne had been here three days now—or was it four?*

The cold had seeped into his bones, a deep ache that wouldn't leave. He sat cross-legged on the stone floor, trying to conserve warmth, but the dampness had long since soaked through his robes. His muscles cramped from maintaining the position. The cell smelled of mold and human waste—his own, from the bucket in the corner—and something else. Old iron. Old fear.

His stomach had stopped growling yesterday. Now it was just a hollow, gnawing ache. His tongue felt thick and dry despite the moisture in the air. They'd brought him water once. Brackish, tasting of rust, but he'd drunk it anyway.

His spellbook confiscated, his component pouch taken. But they hadn't found the small piece of copper wire sewn into his collar. And more importantly, they couldn't take what was in his mind. The bruise on the back of his skull throbbed with his heartbeat. His wrists bore rope burns, raw and weeping.

From somewhere above, voices rose in chanting. Ritual work. The air tasted of ozone and old blood—metallic, thick, making his teeth ache.

*Lucian.*

The cultist had called someone "the mistress." Which meant there WAS someone in charge here. Someone powerful enough to command thralls and cultists. Someone people avoided talking about.

Could it be her? The witch from the legends? The one Lucian had been searching for?

Or was it just a cult leader? A hedge wizard playing at power?

He didn't know. But cultists with thralls didn't capture people for no reason. And that ritual chanting meant *something* was happening above. Something bad. The sound made his skin crawl, words in a language that hurt to hear.

Three days of cold stone and darkness. Three days of fear cycling through determination and back again. Sometimes, in the worst moments, he wondered if he'd die here. If Lucian had died in a cell just like this one, eight years ago. The thought made his chest tighten, breath coming short.

*No.* He pushed the fear down, forced his breathing to steady despite the cold making him shiver.

But traps could be escaped.

And if whoever had captured him knew something—*anything*—about what happened to his son eight years ago...

*I'm coming, Lucian. If you left any trace here, if anyone knows what happened to you... I'll find it.*

Through the iron bars—cold metal that left his hands aching whenever he gripped them—Theron surveyed his prison. A hulking figure slumped against the far wall—his guard, snoring heavily, breath whistling through broken teeth. A ring of keys glinted at his belt, catching the torchlight. Behind his straw pallet—musty, rank with old sweat and despair—he'd noticed loose stones where the mortar had crumbled away. With effort, he might widen that gap... but to where? And sitting motionless in the corner, watching him with unusual intelligence, was a rat. Witches kept familiars. Was this one of hers, watching him? Or just a rat?

The witch—if she even existed, if that's who was up there—wanted to keep him imprisoned.

She'd learn that wizards were harder to cage than she thought.
