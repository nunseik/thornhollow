# Chapter 5: The Apothecary

**Maren's Apothecary** stood crooked beside the chapel, as if leaning away from the holy ground. The sign above the door was hand-painted and faded: *"Maren's Remedies & Rarities — No Refunds."*

The smell hit him before he crossed the threshold: dried herbs—thyme and sage, sharp and earthy—sulfur, something floral and sweet like roses, something *rotten* underneath it all, decay and death. The combination made his eyes water. Bundles of plants hung from every rafter, brushing his head as he entered, dried leaves crumbling at the touch. Shelves sagged under the weight of jars, vials, bones, feathers, stones—all labeled in faded ink. Dust motes swirled in the dim light filtering through grimy windows. A stuffed owl watched him from a high perch, glass eyes glinting with an unsettling awareness.

Behind the counter sat a woman who might be sixty or might be six hundred. Her hair was white and wild, escaping from what had once been a practical bun. She wore the simple, sturdy clothing of someone who worked with their hands—linen shirt worn soft with age, leather apron stained with decades of plant matter and alchemical experiments, the leather cracked and supple. Her fingers, moving with practiced efficiency as she ground something in a mortar—the rhythmic scrape of stone on stone filling the shop—were stained green and brown with herb residue and ink, the lines of her hands dark with it. She smelled of rosemary and earth. She didn't look up, but her eyes—when they briefly flicked toward him—were sharp and knowing, the color of rain-soaked stone, missing nothing.

"You smell like river water and witch-curse," she said. "Also desperation. What do you need?"

Theron scanned the cluttered shelves, mind racing through possibilities. His thumb found his index finger, beginning the familiar slide—index to middle to ring to pinky—as he calculated.

"Charcoal and herbs. Phosphorescent moss. A pouch of salt." He pointed to each in turn. "And I need a focus. Preferably two."

Maren's eyebrow rose—a gesture that involved her entire weathered face.

"Two foci? Ambitious." She set down her mortar and began gathering his selections with surprising speed. "Most wizards I've known barely manage one without setting themselves on fire."

"Most wizards you've known weren't assaulting Thornhollow Castle tonight."

Her hands paused. Just for a moment. Then she continued, her voice carefully neutral.

"Thornhollow, is it." Not a question. "Well. That explained the desperation."

---

She laid out his components on the counter:

- **Charcoal & herbs** — 1 silver
- **Phosphorescent moss** — 2 copper
- **Salt (pouch)** — 2 copper

*Running total: 1 silver, 4 copper*

Then she reached beneath the counter and produced the gnarled oak wand—twisted, rough-hewn, the wood still bearing bark in places—but humming faintly when his fingers brushed it. The vibration traveled up his arm, warm and alive.

"Two silver for this. It's ugly, but it'll channel clean." Her voice was rough, like grinding stone.

*That would leave him with 4 copper. Not enough for the pendant.*

Theron's fingers absently checked his component pouch—empty except for what he'd just purchased. The gesture was automatic, a reflex from years of inventory management. His thumb resumed its slide across his fingers.

Maren watched him calculate. A slow smile crept across her face.

"You're short."

"I'm aware."

She drummed her stained fingers on the counter, the wood hollow beneath her touch. Then, without warning, she reached up to a high shelf—her joints creaking audibly—and retrieved the cracked crystal pendant. It caught the dim light, refracting it into pale rainbows across the cluttered walls, dancing across jars and bones.

"Tell you what, wizard."

She set the pendant beside the wand.

"I'll give you both foci—wand *and* pendant—for two silver total. Call it a discount."

Theron narrowed his eyes. "What's the catch?"

"No catch. Just... *investment*." Her sharp gaze pinned him in place. "That witch has been a shadow over this valley for longer than you've been alive. Longer than *I've* been alive, and I've been alive a *very* long time."

She was silent for a long moment, stained fingers tracing the edge of the cracked pendant, the crystal smooth beneath her touch. Then she spoke, voice rougher than before, thick with something held back for too long.

"Her name was Lily." The words came slow, like pulling splinters. Her jaw worked. "My little sister. Thirty years younger than me—my mother's late-life surprise." A ghost of a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "She had a gift for growing things. Could coax blooms from stones, practically. Wanted to be a healer."

Maren reached beneath the counter and pulled out a battered leather journal, its binding cracked and worn, edges soft from years of handling. She flipped it open to a page marked with pressed flowers—moonpetals, their petals still faintly luminescent even decades later, delicate as tissue paper against the yellowed page. The smell of old paper and dried flowers rose between them.

"Thirty years ago, she was nineteen. Bright. Curious. *Stubborn*." Maren's jaw tightened. "Heard about a patch of moonpetals growing in the deep woods near Thornhollow. They're rare—only bloom under the new moon, and they're powerful for healing salves. She wanted to make medicine for the valley, help people."

She looked up, and for the first time, Theron saw real pain in her weathered face. Her eyes were wet, though no tears fell.

"I told her not to go. Those woods belonged to the witch even then—everyone knew it, even if no one would *say* it. But Lily..." She shook her head, a strand of white hair falling loose. "She said the woods belonged to everyone. That knowledge shouldn't be hoarded behind fear. She had her mother's stubbornness and her father's courage, and not a lick of my caution." Her voice cracked on the last word.

Maren closed the journal with deliberate care, the leather binding creaking. Her hands trembled slightly.

"She left at dawn. Said she'd be back by sunset. Had her gathering basket, her knife, her map." A pause. "She never came back. I searched for three days. Found her basket, overturned. The moonpetals, scattered. Signs of a struggle. And then... *nothing*."

Theron's thumb moved slowly across his fingers—index to middle to ring to pinky. The rhythm unconscious, processing grief he recognized too well.

Her fingers drummed the counter, sharp and rhythmic.

"Within a month, the village forgot her. Not gradually—*suddenly*. People I'd known all my life, people who'd known Lily since she was a baby, looked at me with blank faces when I said her name. Her friends couldn't remember her. The *priest* couldn't find her in the records." Her voice sharpened like a blade. "Szeth-Kaan's work. Even then, the demon was feeding, erasing her from memory to sustain itself."

"But you remember." Theron's observation was quiet, precise—identifying the crucial variable in her equation. His thumb traced the pattern again—index to pinky, a meditation on memory and loss.

"Because I write *everything* down." She tapped the journal. "Every name. Every face. Every person the witch has taken. I started the day after Lily vanished—wrote down everything I could remember about her. And I've been writing ever since. Thirty years of names the world forgot."

She opened the journal again, the pages crackling softly, and Theron saw page after page of careful handwriting—ink faded on some pages, fresh on others. Names. Dates. Brief descriptions. *Johan, miller's son, age 24. Disappeared autumn equinox. Sarah, tinker, age 31. Last seen near Thornhollow road.* Each entry precise, loving, remembered.

Dozens of names. Maybe hundreds. The weight of thirty years of grief, pressed between pages.

"This valley has bled for generations," Maren said. "And everyone forgets. The demon makes sure of it. But *I* remember. I keep the records. I tend the herbs. And I wait."

"Let me ask—why didn't you go after her yourself?" Theron's voice was careful, scholarly. "After the witch, I mean?"

Maren's laugh was bitter. "You think I didn't want to? I was forty-nine years old, wizard. I knew herbs and potions, not battle magic. I had no training with weapons, no allies who believed me, and every attempt to organize resistance..." She gestured vaguely. "People forget. Or they refuse to believe. Or they're too afraid. The witch has built her power on isolation—no one fights what they can't remember, and no one remembers what they never knew threatened them."

She leaned forward, both hands flat on the counter, the wood creaking under the pressure. Her face was close enough that he could see every line, every weathered crease carved by three decades of grief.

"I've spent thirty years keeping records. Helping travelers when they pass through. Supplying hedge wizards and witch hunters and foolish heroes who think *they'll* be different." Her eyes bored into him, fierce and desperate. "Most never come back. The ones who do... usually run. Leave the valley. Try to forget." Her breath smelled of mint tea and bitter herbs.

"And you blame them for that?" Theron asked, his tone precise, analytical. "For choosing survival?"

"No." The word was tired. "I understand. Survival is... survival. But it doesn't bring Lily back. Doesn't avenge the others. Doesn't stop the witch from taking *more*." She pushed the pendant and wand toward him. "So when someone like you shows up—someone who's already been inside, who's escaped, who has *fire* in their eyes instead of just fear—I invest."

"You're using me as a weapon." Theron's observation was measured, analytical—no judgment in the words. Simply identifying the pattern. "An investment in retribution."

"Yes." She didn't flinch from it. "But I think you're using yourself as one too. We both want the same thing. The witch ended. The demon banished. The bleeding *stopped*." Her voice dropped. "If you die in there, at least you'll die for something. And if you succeed..."

For the first time, something almost like hope flickered across her face. Her eyes brightened, the wet sheen catching light.

"If you succeed, maybe I can finally stop writing names in this damned book." Her voice broke, just slightly.

Her hand rested on the journal like a benediction over graves, fingers spread across the worn leather as if she could feel every name pressed into the pages beneath.

"So you take these." She tapped the pendant and wand. "You burn that castle to the ground. And if you meet whatever's wearing my sister's bones..."

She didn't finish.

She didn't need to.

*Theron nodded slowly.*

"I'll do what I can. Though I should clarify—" His fingers tapped the counter. "What I can do may not align with what needs to be done."

"Do more than you can." Maren's hands paused in their wrapping. "That's what heroes are for."

She looked at him for a long moment, really *looked*—at the exhaustion in his face, the determination in his eyes, the way he held himself like someone who'd already accepted he might not come back.

"You've lost someone too," she said. Not a question.

"My son. Eight years ago. Let me think..." His fingers checked the empty component pouch again—a hollow gesture, like reaching for something that would never be there. "Eight years, two months, sixteen days." The precision was armor. Under his breath, barely audible: *"Lux... perpetua..."* Fragment of a spell he'd never finished casting. Fragment of a prayer no god had answered.

Something shifted in her expression. Understanding. Shared grief creating a bridge between two strangers. Her shoulders dropped, the defensive hardness easing.

"Then you know." She finished wrapping the components with careful precision, her movements gentler now. The paper crinkled beneath her fingers. "What it's like. The not knowing. The wondering if there was something you could have done differently. The way the world keeps turning while you're still stuck in the moment they vanished." Her voice was soft, almost tender.

"Every day." Theron's voice was quiet, precise. "The variables change—weather, location, circumstance—but the equation remains unsolved. Every day." His thumb moved again—index to middle to ring to pinky—the slow slide of counting losses, measuring grief in familiar gestures.

Maren nodded once, sharp and final. She placed the wrapped bundle in his hands, the package warm from her touch, the paper rough beneath his fingers.

"Then make it *mean* something. Your pain. My pain. Lily's death. Your son's disappearance. All of it." Her weathered face was fierce, eyes blazing. "Make the witch pay for every name in this book. For every family like yours and mine."

Theron's hand closed around the component pouch, feeling the weight of what he carried now—not just components, but thirty years of grief, eight years of searching, countless lives lost. His thumb traced the familiar pattern one more time—a promise sealed in gesture.

She pulled out a scrap of paper, wrote something quickly, and tucked it into his component pouch.

"That's my name and this shop's location. If you survive..." She paused, as if surprised by her own words. "If you survive and you actually manage to end this nightmare, come find me. There'll be work to do. Helping the survivors, undoing the damage, making sure people *remember* properly."

"And if I don't survive?" Theron asked. A hypothesis that required testing. "What then?"

"Then I'll add your name to the book." She said it without cruelty. Just fact. "Theron Ashborne, wizard, died trying to end the Witch of Thornhollow. And I'll remember you. Like I remember all the others."

It should be morbid. Grim. But somehow, coming from her, it felt like a promise. Like insurance that even if he failed, someone would know he'd *tried*. His thumb moved across his fingers one last time, a benediction over his own potential grave.

"Thank you." Theron's words were measured, deliberate. He meant them with the full weight of academic precision—gratitude as certainty, not sentiment.

"Don't thank me yet." But her eyes were almost warm. "Save it for when you come back."

But Maren didn't say it. And neither did he.

Theron pocketed the components, feeling their weight settle against his hip, reassuring and real. He hung the pendant around his neck, the chain cold against his skin. The crystal rested against his chest, cool and faintly pulsing—like a second heartbeat, slightly out of sync with his own. He could feel the magic in it, unstable but powerful, humming against his sternum.

The wand fit his grip as if carved for it, the rough wood warm against his palm, grooves and bark pressing into his skin. Not elegant. Not pretty. But *ready*.

Whisper emerged from his hood, eyeing the pendant.

"Cracked crystal. Unstable resonance." He sniffed. "You're going to do something reckless with that, aren't you?"

"Probably."

"Good. I'd hate to have chosen a *boring* wizard."

---

Maren watched him turn toward the door.

"One more thing."

Theron paused.

She held out a small leather pouch, no larger than his thumb.

"Powdered iron. On the house." Her eyes glittered. "For the wards. You'll need it."

**The Tavern Awaits**

Theron stepped out of Maren's shop, the new components secure in his pouch, the wand at his belt feeling right in a way he hadn't felt in days. The pendant hung cool against his chest, pulsing faintly with residual magic.

Whisper emerged from his hood, sniffing the evening air.

"The Drowned Crow is three streets over. Sera and Tomren should be there by now."

"One last meal." Theron's murmur carried the weight of ritual, of preparation. "Before we walk into the dark. Do you know if they serve anything substantive, or should I expect battlefield rations disguised as stew?"

"Technically, you've already walked into the dark once," Whisper pointed out. "This would be the second time. Which makes it a pattern, not an adventure."

"Encouraging."

"I do what I can."

The rain was beginning—light drops at first, cold against his face, but with the promise of more to come. The smell of wet stone and approaching storm filled the air. The storm that would mask their assault was building. Thunder rumbled in the distance, low and ominous.

Theron pulled his hood up, the fabric rough against his ears, and headed toward the tavern. His boots splashed through forming puddles. Toward his companions. Toward whatever came next.
