# Chapter 7: Into the Dark

*The rain was relentless.*

It hammered down in sheets, cold needles against their faces, turning the road to sucking mud that pulled at their boots with every step. The water soaked through robes within minutes—first the shoulders, then seeping down the back, the chest, until the fabric clung cold and heavy, chafing with every movement. Theron's hair was plastered to his forehead, water running into his eyes, down his neck in icy rivulets. But there was a strange comfort in it—the storm masked their approach, drowned their footsteps with its constant roar, blinded any watchers the witch might have posted.

Sera led the way, moving with a soldier's efficiency despite the mud sucking at her boots, each step making soft squelching sounds. Tomren brought up the rear, crossbow wrapped in oilcloth, eyes scanning the treeline through the rain-blurred darkness. Theron walked between them, one hand on his wand—the wood slick beneath his wet palm—the other shielding his face from the downpour. His legs ached from fighting the mud. His fingers were going numb.

Whisper had retreated deep into his hood, a small warm presence against his neck, fur damp despite the shelter.

"I hate rain," the familiar mutters.

"You're a rat. I thought rats liked sewers."

"That's a vicious stereotype."

**Two Hours Later — The Edge of Thornhollow Forest**

The trees rose before them like a wall of shadows, branches clawing at the stormy sky. Even in daylight, this forest would feel wrong—the branches twisted at unnatural angles, bark ridged and cracked like diseased skin, the undergrowth grew thick and grasping, thorns catching at their clothes. And there was a *smell* beneath the rain. Decay—not the clean rot of autumn leaves, but something putrid, like week-old meat left in the sun. Old magic, sharp and metallic on the tongue, making teeth ache. Something watching.

The temperature dropped as they approached. Not gradually—*sharply*. As if stepping across an invisible threshold into winter. One moment, rain-soaked and miserable. The next, *freezing*, the cold biting through wet clothes like knives. Theron's breath misted in white clouds. His wet fingers went numb around his wand, joints stiffening, the skin turning pale. His damp robes felt like ice pressed against his skin.

"Do you feel that?" he whispered. "The temperature drop—it's too sharp to be natural."

"Unnatural cold. Something's changed the air itself," Tomren said, voice low and steady.

"Dark magic," Whisper corrected from the hood. "Centuries of it, seeping into the land like poison into groundwater. The forest has been *changed*. It remembers every soul she's taken here."

Sera held up a fist. They stopped.

"Lost our first scout here," she said quietly, rain streaming down her scarred face. "Thirty paces in. Found the body seven days later, two miles out. No wounds. No marks." She paused. "No eyes."

"That's a grim find," Tomren said, his jaw tight.

"The forest itself isn't the danger," Whisper said from his hood. "It's her *awareness*. The trees, the animals, the shadows—they report to her. We need to move quickly and quietly."

Theron peered into the darkness between the trunks. His left thumb moved unconsciously across his fingertips—index, middle, ring, pinky—calculating risks, planning routes.

"Can you guide us around her watchpoints? Or are they too densely distributed?"

"Some of them. Not all." The familiar's voice is grim. "She's had centuries to weave her web. But there are... dead zones. Places where her attention doesn't reach. Old shrines. Cursed ground. Areas she's learned to avoid."

Sera exchanges a glance with Tomren. Her eyes swept the treeline—counting shadows, assessing angles, automatic as breathing. She rolled her shoulders once, a fighter's preparation.

"We follow the rat's lead, then."

---

The darkness under the canopy is absolute, pressing against their eyes like a physical weight. Rain and storm clouds have stolen what little daylight remained. The forest floor squelched beneath their boots, mud and rotting leaves releasing the smell of decomposition with every step. Water dripped from branches overhead, cold drops hitting necks and faces without warning.

Theron pulled the phosphorescent moss from his component pouch—Maren's gift. He crushed a small amount between his numb fingers, the moss releasing a faint earthy smell as it began to glow with a pale greenish light. The luminescence pulsed faintly, like a slow heartbeat. Not bright enough to carry far, but enough to see the twisted roots and dark hollows beneath their feet.

"Smart thinking," Sera whispered, watching the pale illumination. "Risk of detection?"

"Natural light," Whisper confirmed. "The forest is full of it. Her watchers won't notice one more patch of glowing fungus."

---

Whisper guided them through the forest like a thread through a needle. Left around the hollow oak—a raven nested there, one of hers. Right past the standing stones—she didn't look there anymore, not since something had driven her out decades ago. Straight through the stream, the water masking their scent.

Theron crushed more moss as needed, leaving faint glowing markers behind them—a trail back to safety, should they need it. His fingers found the component pouch at his belt, touching the silk bundle of Maren's gift with something like reverence.

Tomren's foot snaps a branch—the crack sharp and loud despite the rain, echoing through the unnatural silence.

They all freeze, hearts hammering, breath held.

*Silence. Rain pattering on leaves. Thunder rumbling in the distance.*

Then—movement in the canopy above. Something large, shifting between branches with a sound like leather scraping over wood. The sound of wings, leathery and wet, displacing air with heavy beats. A smell wafted down—carrion and sulfur, making Theron's stomach turn.

Theron's hand tightened on his wand, knuckles white, palm sweating despite the cold. He didn't look up. Looking up meant looking away from the path, losing his footing, making noise. His pulse thundered in his ears. Under his breath, barely audible over the pounding of his own heartbeat: "*Praesidium... tenebris...*" Half-formed incantation fragments, nervous energy seeking outlet.

The thing above them *screamed*—not a bird's cry, but something that sounded almost human. Almost. The sound vibrated through their chests, primal and wrong, making every instinct scream *run*.

Then it was gone, the sound of heavy wings fading into the storm, leaving only the smell of death behind.

"One of hers?" Sera breathed.

"One of many," Whisper confirmed, trembling. "Move. *Faster*."

---

**One Hour Later — The Ravine**

Theron emerged from the treeline onto familiar ground, boots sliding on wet stone at the ravine's edge. The ravine stretched before him, a dark gash in the earth, the river churning far below with the roar of swollen stormwater—white foam visible even in the darkness, the sound like continuous thunder. The spray reached up, misting their faces with icy droplets. And above, barely visible through the sheets of rain—

**Thornhollow Castle.**

It clung to the cliffside like a growth, like a cancer of stone, all twisted spires and dark stone that seemed to drink the light. Lightning illuminated it in brilliant flashes: a window here, reflecting white light like a dead eye; a battlement there, sharp against the storm; the great iron doors that he'd never enter through, studded and massive and forbidding.

But they weren't going in through the front. The air here tasted of stone and cold water and something else—the faint metallic tang of old blood, carried on the wind from the castle above.

"There." Theron pointed to the drainage grate—still broken, still hanging open. The river rushed past it, higher than before. "That's our entrance."

Sera studied the gap, fingers brushing the locket at her throat. "Water level's high. Half-flooded."

"It was dry when I escaped. The storm's filled it." Theron calculated, thumb moving across his fingertips again—measuring, weighing. "We'll be wading. Maybe swimming in places. But it's still passable."

"If it floods completely while we're inside?"

"Then we find another way out. Or we don't." He met her eyes. "This is the path I know. The path I *survived*."

She held his gaze for a long moment.

Then she nodded.

"Tomren. Get the rope ready."

---

**The Descent**

Tomren anchored the rope to a sturdy oak, testing it with his full weight—the hemp creaking but holding—and one by one, they descended into the ravine. The rocks were slick with rain, sharp edges hidden by moss and running water. More than once, Theron's foot slipped, his boot scraping against stone, hands burning as the rope slid through his palms before he caught himself. The muscles in his arms screamed. His shoulders ached. But the rope held, and his companions held, and somehow they *reached* the bottom without broken bones, landing in ankle-deep water that soaked immediately through his boots.

The river roared past, waist-high and *cold*—not the shocking cold of his first escape, but still brutal, stealing breath, making muscles cramp. The current tugged at their legs, hungry and strong. The drainage grate loomed ahead, a dark mouth in the cliff face, water pouring from it in a constant stream. Even from here, Theron could smell it—the rot, sweet and nauseating; the chemicals, sharp and acrid like burning copper; the wrongness that seeped from the castle's foundations. The smell made his eyes water.

This close to the castle, the air itself felt *heavy*. Oppressive. As if the stones above were watching, waiting, judging. The temperature had dropped again—colder than the forest, colder than should be possible. Their breath came in white clouds.

"Stay close to the walls," Theron shouted over the water. "Don't let the current take you. Maintain contact with the stone."

He entered first.

---

**The Drainage Tunnels**

The darkness swallowed them whole—complete, absolute, pressing against eyes and skin like a living thing.

Water surged around Theron's legs, thigh-deep and freezing, tugging at him with surprising strength. He pressed one hand against the slick stone wall, slime coating the surface, making his palm slide. Wand in the other hand, held high above the water. Behind him, Sera's breathing was steady, controlled despite the cold—he could hear the slight chattering of her teeth between breaths. Tomren cursed softly as he fought the current, the splash of his bulk displacing water echoing off close walls.

The smell down here was worse—not just rot, but *chemical*. Sharp and acrid, like burning copper mixed with sulfur, with something underneath that tasted bitter on the tongue. The residue of dark magic, washed down from whatever horrors happened in the castle above. The stench burned his nostrils, made his eyes water and his stomach heave. He breathed through his mouth, but that only made it worse—he could *taste* it.

"Whisper. Directions." His voice echoed strangely in the confined space.

"Straight for thirty paces. Then the first left—*don't* take the right, it's collapsed now. After that, up."

Theron pushed forward, step by step, muscles straining against the current. The water rose to his chest in places, so cold it made his ribs ache, made breathing difficult. The dark was absolute—he couldn't see his own hand in front of his face, could only feel the slimy wall beneath his palm, the icy water pulling at his robes. His foot touched something soft in the water—yielding, bloated, wrong—he didn't look down, didn't think about what it might be, just kept moving, skin crawling, trying not to imagine.

Then—a split in the tunnel.

"Left," Whisper confirmed.

Theron turned. The water was shallower here, only knee-deep. The tunnel began to slope upward. With each step, the chemical smell faded slightly, replaced by something else—old stone, torch smoke, and underneath it all, the faint metallic tang of blood.

"We're past the flood line now," Theron breathed. "Keep moving upward."

---

**Ten Minutes Later — The Lower Dungeons**

Theron emerged into a corridor he recognized, water streaming from his robes, forming puddles on the stone floor. Torchlight flickered on damp stone walls—the same enchanted flames that never died, casting dancing shadows. The cells lined both sides, iron bars rusted but solid, dark openings like mouths. The air here was warmer than the tunnels but still cold, still damp, smelling of mold and human waste and old fear.

His cell was there. Third on the left. The door still hung open, darkness beyond. Seeing it again made his chest tighten, memories flooding back—the cold, the hunger, the despair.

But they weren't alone.

**A thrall stood at the far end of the corridor.**

It had been human once. That was the worst part—the remnants of humanity still visible beneath what she'd done to it. It wore the tattered remains of a merchant's clothes, now filthy and torn, stained with things best not examined. Its skin had a gray pallor, like week-old corpse flesh, waxy and slack. The smell reached them even at this distance—rot and decay, the sweet-putrid stench of meat left too long. Its eyes...

Its eyes were *empty*. Not dead—worse than dead. *Hollowed out*. Whatever made this person a person was gone, consumed, leaving only the shell behind to serve. Looking into those eyes was like looking into an abyss.

The thrall swayed slightly, head tilted at an unnatural angle, as if listening to voices they couldn't hear. Its jaw hung slightly open, revealing teeth stained dark. It hadn't seen them yet, but its nostrils flared, sniffing the air.

Sera's hand moved to her sword, steel whispering against leather. Her eyes tracked the corridor—two exits, one alcove, no cover. Tomren silently raised his crossbow, bolt aimed center mass, and positioned himself at Sera's back without a word.

Whisper's claws dug into Theron's shoulder.

"There's another one," the familiar breathed. "Around the corner. I can smell it."

*Two thralls. One visible, one hidden.*

Theron's throat tightened. He'd read about thralls—victims of domination magic, their wills crushed, their souls trapped in their own bodies like prisoners. Some traditions said they were aware. Conscious. Screaming silently behind dead eyes while their bodies obeyed.

He didn't know if that was true.

He hoped it wasn't.

Theron reached for his component pouch, pulling out the charcoal and herbs Maren had given him. He whispered the incantation for *Find Familiar*—not to summon, but to *sense*. The magic rippled outward, searching for other bound creatures nearby.

*A spider in the corner. Two rats in the walls. All hers. All watching.*

But none were looking this direction. Yet.

"Her eyes are here," Theron breathed. "Multiple watchers—but none are looking this direction. We need to move immediately before they shift position."

---

## Sneaking Past

Theron held up a hand, stopping Sera mid-draw. She looked at him, questioning. He shook his head slowly and pointed to the branching corridor on his left—a narrow passage, half-hidden in shadow. His thumb traced the familiar pattern across his fingers: plan, adapt, survive.

"Around," he mouthed silently.

Sera's jaw tightened. Every instinct in her screamed to fight, to push forward, to find Elina *now*. But she was a soldier. She understood tactics.

She nodded.

---

They moved like ghosts, each step careful, breath held.

The side passage was tight—single file, shoulders brushing rough stone on both sides, the walls cold and damp. Water dripped from somewhere above, the sound echoing in the confined space, each drop loud in the silence. The torchlight didn't reach here; they navigated by touch—hands scraping against wet stone—by Whisper's whispered directions barely audible over their own breathing, by the faint phosphorescent glow of moss clinging to the ceiling like diseased stars. The air was stale, thick with the smell of mold and something older, earthier—grave dirt.

Theron's foot caught on something. He looked down, the faint moss-light just enough to see—

A child's shoe. Small, leather, well-worn with age and use. The laces still tied in a careful bow. Lying discarded against the wall like refuse, half-buried in dust and debris.

His stomach turned, bile rising in his throat. He didn't stop moving—couldn't afford to—but the image burned into his mind, searing itself behind his eyes. Someone's child had worn that shoe. Walked in it. Played in it. Learned to tie those laces with small, clumsy fingers. And now it was here, in this dark passage, abandoned like everything else the witch had taken. *How old? Six? Seven?*

How many? How many shoes, how many lockets, how many fragments of lives cut short lay forgotten in these shadows?

The thrall's swaying shadow passed across the main corridor behind them, elongated and distorted in the torchlight. It didn't turn, its jerking movements carrying it past their hiding place.

Theron heard the second one now—shuffling footsteps, slow and uneven, dragging across stone. A wet rattling breath, phlegmy and labored, echoing in the passage. It was close. *Too* close. His heart hammered against his ribs so hard he thought the thrall must hear it.

Sera pressed flat against the wall, sword hand trembling with the effort of staying still. Tomren did the same, going absolutely still—that hunter's stillness, breathing slowed almost to nothing, absorbing every sound. Theron held his breath until his lungs burned, pulse thundering in his ears.

*Shuffle. Shuffle. Pause.*

The thrall stood at the intersection, inches away—so close Theron could have reached out and touched it. He could smell it—rot and old blood and something chemically *wrong*, sharp and nauseating, making his eyes water. Its head turned slowly, nostrils flaring as it sniffed the air. Looking for them. *Smelling* for them.

Whisper's claws dug into his neck, tiny pinpoints of pain. A warning. The familiar had gone completely rigid, not even breathing.

*Don't move. Don't breathe. Don't—*

Through the gap between the walls, Theron saw the thrall's profile, illuminated by distant torchlight. Half its face was covered in ritual scars—the witch's marks, burned into dead flesh, raised and weeping. Its mouth hung open, jaw slack, revealing teeth filed to points, blackened and broken. Its tongue moved, tasting the air. A low moan escaped its throat, barely human.

*What did she do to you?*

The thrall stood there for an eternity—five seconds, ten, fifteen—head tilted, listening, sniffing. Theron's lungs screamed for air. Black spots danced in his vision.

Then, finally, the thrall moved on, shuffling deeper into the dungeons, that wet rattling breath fading into the darkness.

---

Theron waited a full minute before exhaling.

"That was too close for comfort," Tomren whispered, breath still controlled.

"Actually, that was *necessary*," Theron countered. "If we'd fought, the other would have raised the alarm. Now we're past them both, and they don't know we're here."

Sera said nothing, but her hand briefly squeezed his shoulder.

---

**The Passage Ascends**

The narrow corridor sloped upward, carved stairs emerging from the stone—ancient, worn smooth by centuries of use. This wasn't part of the dungeon proper. It was older. Part of whatever had existed here before the witch claimed it.

"Servants' passage," Whisper murmured. "She sealed most of them off, but this one..." He paused, sniffing. "This one she forgot. Or chose to ignore."

"Where does this passage lead?"

"If I remember correctly... the kitchens. Abandoned now. She doesn't eat—not food, anyway."

"And from the kitchens? What access points?"

"Access to the main hall. The study. The ritual chamber." His voice dropped. "And her private quarters."

---

Theron climbed in silence, legs burning with the effort, thighs cramping from the endless stairs. Each step worn smooth by centuries of use, the stone cold beneath his wet boots. The stairs seemed endless—spiraling upward through the guts of the castle, narrow and steep, one hand on the wall for balance. The walls grew drier as they climbed, the damp chill giving way to something warmer but no less oppressive. The air grew warmer, stuffier, smelling less of mold and more of torch smoke and old stone. Torchlight began to seep through cracks in the stonework, pale orange lines in the darkness.

Then—voices, drifting down from above.

Theron froze.

Not thralls. *Words*. Muffled, distant, but unmistakably speech. Tomren went utterly still behind them, head tilted, absorbing every syllable.

*"...the binding holds, but she grows impatient..."*

*"...the sacrifice must be prepared by the third moon..."*

*"...what of the escaped prisoner?..."*

A long pause.

*"...irrelevant now. The Herald stirs. Nothing else matters..."*

The voices faded, footsteps retreating.

Sera's eyes met his in the darkness. *The witch has servants. Human ones.*

"Cultists," Whisper confirmed grimly. "She's been recruiting. Promising power, immortality, the usual lies."

"How many cultists total?"

"Unknown. At least a handful. Possibly more."

A low hum escaped Tomren's throat as he calculated. Then he adjusted his crossbow tension—*click-click-click*—the sound barely audible but familiar. "More targets to account for."

"More *complications*," Sera corrected, hand shifting her sword position slightly. "Threat assessment just increased."

---

**The Abandoned Kitchen**

Theron emerged through a crumbling doorway into a vast, decayed space. Stone ovens lined one wall, cold and dark, their mouths yawning like empty caves. Rusted pots hung from hooks, coated in thick grime, some so corroded they'd fused to the metal. A long wooden table—rotted, collapsed in the middle like a broken spine—dominated the center of the room. Shattered pottery littered the floor, crunching softly beneath their boots.

Dust lay thick on everything, motes swirling in the faint light from cracks in the ceiling, coating their throats, making them want to cough. The air tasted stale, ancient, undisturbed for decades. Cobwebs hung in corners like funeral shrouds, thick and gray.

But through the far doorway, they saw torchlight flickering against stone. Movement—shadows passing. Voices, distant but audible. The castle proper. The living parts. And underneath the decay, underneath the dust and mold—that smell again. Blood. Old and dried, but *so much of it* that the scent had soaked into the very stones, into the mortar between, a permanent stain. The metallic tang was overwhelming, coating their tongues.

"We're inside the castle proper now," Theron breathed.

Whisper hopped from his shoulder onto the collapsed table, surveying the exits.

"Three paths from here. Left leads to the great hall—that's where the ritual chamber connects. Straight leads to the upper corridors—the study, her quarters. Right leads to the old tower—storage, mostly, but also..."

He hesitated.

"Also what?" Sera demanded, voice sharp.

"The cells where she keeps *special* prisoners. The ones she wants to preserve."

Sera went very still.

"Elina."

"Possibly. If she's alive, if the witch values her for some reason—that's where she'd be."

---

*Three paths. Three objectives.*

The study held his spellbook—his power, his identity, his best chance at turning the tide.

The ritual chamber held Szeth-Kaan—the true threat, the ticking clock, the thing that would erase Millhaven from existence if left unchecked.

The old tower held Elina—a mother's daughter, an innocent, the reason Sera was here at all.

Theron couldn't do all three at once. Not without splitting up.

But before anyone could speak, Whisper went rigid on the table. His whiskers quivered, nostrils flaring.

"Wait." The familiar's voice was sharp. "I smell... blood. Fresh. And something else. Ritual components. Activated ones."

A chill ran down Theron's spine. "What does that mean? The timing—"

"It means she's not waiting." Whisper's eyes were wide. "The voices said 'third moon,' but that's—" He counted on tiny claws. "That's *tonight*. She's accelerating. The ritual is happening *now*."

---

## Breaking the Promise

Sera moved immediately toward the right corridor—toward the tower, toward Elina. Her hand found the locket at her throat, gripping it tight enough that her knuckles went white, the chain biting into her neck. "Move fast, then. Extract her first per the plan, then—"

"No." Theron's voice was sharper than he intended, echoing in the dead kitchen. "We can't."

She whirled on him, boots scraping on the dusty floor. "We *agreed*. In the forest. Elina first. You *promised*." Her eyes blazed, scarred face tight with fury and fear.

"I know what we agreed—"

"Then we execute the plan!" Her voice cracked, raw with emotion. "My daughter is in that tower. Right there. *Right there*." She gestured violently toward the corridor, hand shaking. "We are not—"

"The ritual is happening *now*, Sera." Theron took a step closer, keeping his voice low but urgent. "Let me think this through—if Szeth-Kaan completes its work, none of us walk out. Not you, not me, not Tomren, and not Elina. The demon will erase this entire castle, everyone in it, and everything we are from existence."

"Then we move *faster*—"

"There's no such thing as fast enough!" His frustration bled through, academic precision sharpening. "Without my spellbook, I'm useless against whatever's waiting in that ritual chamber. Cantrips won't stop an ancient herald. Minor illusions won't disrupt a binding circle." He met her eyes. "You need me at full power. And I need that book."

Sera's fingers traced the locket at her throat—around the edge, over the clasp, again and again. A lifeline. Her other hand had formed a fist at her side, trembling, nails digging into her palm hard enough to draw blood.

"You're asking me to leave her." Her voice was barely a whisper, thick with unshed tears. "Walk past. Choose *magic* over my child." Her breath came faster, shorter, chest heaving.

"I'm asking you to trust that the best way to save her is to stop the thing that will kill her anyway."

"No." Sera shook her head violently, white hair coming loose from its braid, falling across her scarred face. "No. We made a deal. You *agreed*—Elina first, study second. Those were your words. Looked me in the eye and—" Her voice broke completely, the last word dissolving into a choked sound.

Tomren stepped between them, his bulk filling the space.

"Sera." His voice was gentle but firm. "Listen to me for a moment."

"Don't, Tomren. Don't you dare take his side—"

"I'm taking *reality's* side." He gripped both her shoulders, forcing her to look at him. "The circumstances changed. That conversation we overheard—'the Herald stirs,' 'the sacrifice must be prepared'—this isn't happening in three days. It's happening *tonight*."

"So we save her *now*—"

"And fight the witch with a wizard who can barely cast?" Tomren's voice hardened. "I've seen what happens when good soldiers die because commanders ignored the facts on the ground. I've *been* that soldier, bleeding out in the mud because someone was too proud to adapt to reality."

Sera's eyes shone with unshed tears, the torchlight catching the wetness, making them gleam. Her thumb pressed against the locket so hard it left a deep red mark on her skin, the metal biting into flesh. "She's been in there for six months. Six months of terror, not knowing if anyone was coming. And now I'm here—*finally here*—and you want me to walk past her cell? Prioritize *books*?" The last word came out bitter, spat like poison.

"I want you to prioritize *success*." Tomren didn't let go, his large hands steady on her shoulders. "I want you to get her out alive. Not die trying because we rushed in half-armed against an ancient demon."

"We had a plan—"

"Plans change when the situation changes." His voice gentled, rough with emotion. "You taught me that. Kren's Crossing, remember? We had a plan there too. Went to hell in the first five minutes. And you *adapted*. Changed tactics, saved half the garrison, saved *me*." He squeezed her shoulders, trying to ground her. "Do that now. Adapt. Choose the path that actually gets your daughter home."

Silence filled the kitchen, broken only by the distant drip of water and their ragged breathing.

Sera stood there, trembling—her whole body shaking like a leaf in a storm. Her fingers traced the locket over and over—desperate circles, a prayer made physical, the metal warming from the repetition. Her jaw worked, muscles jumping beneath her skin. Her eyes squeezed shut, sending two tears streaming down her scarred face, carving clean lines through the dust and grime. Her breath came in short gasps, each one sounding like it hurt.

"I can't..." The words choked out, barely audible, throat closing around them. "I can't just leave her. Not when she's this close." A sob broke free, raw and broken.

"You're not leaving her." Theron's voice is softer now. "You're ensuring she has a mother who survives to rescue her. That's not abandonment. That's love."

More tears escaped, tracking down Sera's scarred face, following the path of old wounds. Her lips trembled. Her hands shook.

"What if she thinks I chose wrong? What if she's in there, listening, hearing footsteps go past her cell..." Her voice broke completely, the words dissolving into ragged breathing. "What if she thinks I didn't come for her?" The question came out as a wail, primal and broken, a mother's worst fear given voice.

The weight of the question hung heavy in the dusty air.

Tomren spoke, his gruff voice thick with emotion, rough as gravel. "Then we'll tell her the truth. That you made the hardest choice a mother can make. Put her survival above your need to hold her. That you were willing to endure that pain so she wouldn't have to endure death."

Sera's shoulders shook violently. One sob escaped, then another, then more—harsh, gasping sounds torn from deep in her chest. Her hand dropped from the locket, fingers opening slowly as if releasing something precious, the chain falling back against her armor with a soft clink. Tears streamed freely now, hot against her cold cheeks.

Then, slowly, painfully, she straightened. Wiped her face roughly with her sleeve, the fabric scraping across her skin, smearing the tears and dust. Rolled her shoulders once, twice—soldier's discipline reasserting itself through sheer force of will, muscles tensing and releasing. Her jaw set. Her hands steadied.

"One hour," she said, voice raw but steady. "Get the spellbook. Prepare. Then—" She looked toward the tower corridor, longing and grief warring in her expression. "Then nothing in this castle keeps me from her. Not the witch. Not her thralls. Not Szeth-Kaan itself."

She turned to Theron, and the look in her eyes was terrifying in its intensity.

"But if we fail because of this choice—if I lose her because I listened to you—" Her hand moved to her sword. "Won't be enough magic in the world to save you from me."

"Understood."

Whisper shifted on the table. "I hate to interrupt the emotional moment, but we have perhaps twenty minutes before the next patrol cycle. If we're doing this, we need to move. *Now*."

Sera took one last look toward the tower corridor—toward where her daughter waited, unknowing, alone, afraid. Her eyes lingered on the darkness of the passage, straining as if she could see through stone and shadow to where Elina lay. Her fingers brushed the locket one final time, trembling, the touch tender as a caress, then fell away—heavy, reluctant, like cutting off a part of herself. Her face was a mask of grief, jaw clenched so tight the muscles stood out like cords, eyes red and wet.

Then, slowly, as if every movement cost her something irreplaceable, she turned toward the study corridor. Away from her daughter. Toward duty. Toward survival.

"Lead the way, wizard." Her voice was raw, scraped hollow.

The words sounded like ashes in her mouth, bitter and dead.
