# Chapter 1: Copper Wire and Shadows

## Cantrip

Theron's fingers found the copper wire sewn into his collar—the one thing his captors had missed. The metal was warm from his body heat, familiar against his fingertips despite days of not touching it. Without his component pouch, without his spellbook, his options were limited. But Message was a cantrip, simple enough to cast from memory alone. His stomach cramped with hunger. The rope burns on his wrists stung as he moved his hands.

He began the incantation in his mind, lips barely moving, hands still. The words tasted like copper and desperation. The guard snored on, breath whistling. The rat watched, motionless in the flickering shadows. The torchlight flickered, casting dancing shapes on the damp stone walls.

With practiced subtlety, he completed the casting without drawing the guard's attention. The magic took hold. He felt the invisible thread of the Message cantrip extend outward—but here was the problem: Message let him whisper to a creature he could see, and they could whisper back. It didn't move objects.

He rubbed his thumb across his fingers—index, middle, ring, pinky—thinking through the possibilities. Message let him whisper to a creature he could see. If the rat *was* a familiar, perhaps he could bargain. If it was just a rat... well, he'd wasted a cantrip.

## The Bargain

*Theron turned his gaze to the rat. Its dark eyes glittered in the torchlight—watching, waiting. He extended the Message cantrip toward it, the copper wire warm between his fingers.*

"Little one," *he whispered through the arcane thread,* "I recognize what you are—a familiar, if I'm correct. I'd like to speak with you."

*A pause. The rat's whiskers twitched.*

Then—a voice in his mind. Dry, amused, ancient.

"Clever little mage. Most prisoners just throw stones at me."

*It was a familiar. The witch's eyes and ears in the dungeon.*

Theron's thumb traced across his fingers, working through possible approaches. He chose his words carefully, keeping his mental voice respectful but not servile.

"How long have you served here?" he asked, keeping his tone neutral. "I'm curious—watching prisoners come and go, does the time become difficult to measure?"

A pause. The rat's whiskers twitched with what might have been surprise.

"Long enough to have seen hundreds. Maybe thousands. They blur together after a while."

"And your master?" Theron probed gently. "Does she acknowledge your contributions? Show appreciation for what you provide?"

The rat's tail flicked—irritation, perhaps.

"My master *uses* me. Eyes where she cannot see. Ears where she cannot hear. But appreciation?" A dry laugh echoed through the mental connection. "Tools are not appreciated. They are simply... utilized."

Theron felt a spark of hope. "That must be profoundly isolating. To serve for centuries, to provide such valuable intelligence, and never be truly *seen* as more than a tool."

"Perceptive," Whisper said, and there was something raw in that ancient voice. "And desperate. Tell me, wizard—why do you ask these questions?"

Theron took a calculated risk. "Because I recognize what you are—more than a simple scout. You possess independent thought. Emotional awareness." He paused, precise despite the urgency. "I propose a mutual exchange. We help each other."

The rat scratched behind its ear, then sat up on its haunches with unsettling poise—an almost human gesture of consideration.

"Clever," the familiar said after a long moment. "Very clever." Its voice shifted, became less guarded. "I've served here longer than your grandfather lived. And I'll admit—it's grown *tedious*. All rituals and blood work. No conversation. No consideration for simple pleasures. Just... work."

It fixed Theron with those knowing eyes.

"I won't betray my master outright. But perhaps I could be... momentarily distracted. Fail to notice certain things. For a price."

The familiar tilted its head.

"When you escape—and you *will* escape, or you'll die, either way—I want you to take me with you. A new contract. A wizard who actually *talks* to me. Do we have a deal?"

Above, a thunderclap. The ritual intensified.

*Theron's hand moved unconsciously to his belt—where his component pouch should have been. Empty. He met the rat's gaze and nodded once, deliberate.*

"Agreed. I accept the terms of your contract."

*The familiar's whiskers twitched—something like a smile, if rats could smile.*

"Wisely done, wizard. My name is Whisper. Remember it."

Whisper scurried toward the sleeping guard with purposeful silence, tiny claws making no sound on the damp stone. Theron watched, barely breathing, as the tiny creature climbed the man's boot—the leather creaking softly—his leg, his belt. With surprisingly dexterous paws, Whisper worked at the keyring's clasp, the faint scraping of metal on metal making Theron's heart hammer.

The keys slid free with a whisper of iron against iron. Whisper dragged them across the flagstones, the metal scraping softly, barely clinking, and pushed them through the gap beneath Theron's cell bars. The sound seemed impossibly loud in the stillness. The guard snorted, shifted, then settled back into snoring.

"Hurry," the familiar hissed, voice urgent. "She's summoning something. When it arrives, she won't need you alive anymore—just your *blood*."

Theron grabbed the cold iron ring, the metal ice against his skin. His fingers trembled—fear or weakness, he wasn't sure. Two keys: one blackened and rough with corrosion, one silver and smooth.

The lock on his cell was old and rusted.

*His thumb rubbed across his fingers—index to pinky—weighing the choice. He chose the blackened key. Instinct—or perhaps the faint smell of sulfur that reminded him of his first evocation lessons. Fire undoes locks. Fire opens ways.*

He jammed it into the rusted mechanism—the metal grinding against corrosion—and twisted. His hand cramped from the effort, muscles weak from days without food.

**Click.**

*The cell door groaned open, hinges shrieking softly in protest.* The sound cut through the silence like a knife. Theron froze, pulse pounding in his ears, waiting for the guard to wake.

The snoring continued. Somehow.

"Good choice," Whisper chittered, scrambling up his leg—claws pricking through his damp robes—to perch on his shoulder. Tiny weight, surprisingly reassuring. "The silver one triggers an alarm."

Theron stepped into the corridor, legs shaky from days of sitting. The stone floor was cold and slick beneath his feet. The air was different here—moving, carrying smells of old stone and distant places. The guard still slept—Whisper's doing, he suspected, more than natural exhaustion. To his left, a spiral staircase climbed toward the sound of that horrible tearing—like reality being pulled apart at the seams. To his right, a darker passage sloped downward, pitch black, carrying the smell of earth and something older. Decay. Ancient water. Things long buried.

Then he heard it.

A voice from above. The witch—but *wrong*. Layered. As if something else was speaking *through* her.

**"THE BINDING IS COMPLETE. NOW... WHERE IS MY SACRIFICE?"**

Footsteps. Coming down the stairs.

Whisper's claws dug into his shoulder.

"Your spellbook is in her study—up. Your freedom is in the old tunnels—down. And your component pouch..." The rat paused. "She's *wearing* it. As a trophy."

*Survival over pride. A wise wizard knows when to flee.*

"Let me think..." *His thumb moved across his fingers—index, middle, ring, pinky.* "Down. We take the tunnels."

"Wisely chosen," Whisper agreed. "I was hoping you'd say that."

Theron plunged into the descending passage, one hand trailing the damp stone wall—slick with moisture and something slimy he tried not to think about—the darkness swallowing him whole. He could see nothing. His boots splashed through puddles he couldn't see, the water seeping through cracks in the leather. The tunnel smelled of wet stone and rot. Behind him, the footsteps reached the dungeon level, echoing up through the passage. A shriek of rage—the witch had found his empty cell. The sound made his bones ache.

**"FIND THE WIZARD. FIND HIM NOW."**

The voice boomed through the tunnels, making dust rain from the ceiling. Theron ran faster, hand scraping against rough stone, lungs burning.

The tunnel twisted, branched, doubled back. His shoulder slammed into a corner he couldn't see in the darkness, pain shooting down his arm. Without Whisper's whispered directions—"left, left, right, straight, ignore that passage it leads to the oubliette"—he'd have been hopelessly lost. The rat's breath was warm against his ear, the only comfort in the cold darkness.

The sounds of pursuit faded, echoing away down wrong passages. The air grew colder, damper—his breath misting—then suddenly *fresher*. He could smell something besides rot. Pine. Night air.

He saw it: a pale sliver of moonlight.

The tunnel opened into a drainage grate overlooking a forest ravine. Moonlight streamed through the iron bars—beautiful, silver, *freedom*. The ironwork was old, rusted, the metal flaking beneath his grip. Cold air washed over his face, sharp and clean after days of dungeon stench. One solid kick might—

He threw his weight against it, shoulder first. Pain exploded through his weakened body. The grate groaned, rust showering down, but held. His shoulder throbbed. Footsteps echoed behind him now in the tunnel—distant, but growing closer. The sound of shambling footsteps. Thralls.

"Again!" Whisper urged.

## Hiding from the Witch

*Theron pressed his back against the cold stone, mind racing through his mental spellbook. Without components, without his focus, his options were limited—but not gone.*

*He still had his mind. And some spells needed nothing more.* His lips moved silently, fragments of an incantation forming unbidden—*"umbra... tenebris..."*

"Whisper," he breathed, precise even in a whisper, "remain motionless. Completely still."

He closed his eyes and wove the incantation for **Minor Illusion**—no components required, just will and words. The magic responded, shaping shadow and silence into a false wall of crumbling stone exactly where he stood, blending seamlessly with the tunnel's ancient architecture.

He held his breath. Whisper became a statue on his shoulder.

Torchlight flickered around the bend. Two figures—no, three. The witch's servants: hollow-eyed thralls with jerking movements, sniffing the air like hounds. They passed the drainage grate. One stopped *directly in front of his illusion*.

Its head tilted. Sniffed.

*Seconds stretched into eternity.*

Then it turned and shambled onward, following the others deeper into the tunnel network.

"They'll circle back," Whisper whispered. "We have minutes."

The grate still stood between him and freedom. Moonlight taunted him through the gaps.

## The Escape?

*A grin spread across his face.*

Theron focused his will, shaping another Minor Illusion just beyond the grate—"Oh, I *like* you," Whisper murmured, sensing his intent—a flickering image of the wizard, stumbling through the moonlit ravine, robes torn, looking back in terror.

He added sound: ragged breathing, snapping twigs, a desperate voice calling out— "This way! I see the river!"

The effect was perfect. His phantom-self scrambled up the ravine with convincing panic, its voice echoing back through the drainage tunnel.

He heard the thralls halt. Then—a horrible screech. They'd taken the bait.

The three servants came *thundering* back down the passage. Theron flattened himself against the wall, his stone-illusion still holding, as they barreled past. The lead thrall didn't slow down.

It *slammed* into the rusted grate with the full force of its unnatural momentum.

**CRASH.**

The sound was deafening in the ravine. The ironwork tore free from the ancient mortar with a screech of tortured metal and tumbled into the ravine below, taking the thrall with it. Theron heard it hit—distant splash, then silence. The other two leapt through the gap without hesitation, pursuing his phantom into the forest. Their footsteps crashed through underbrush, fading quickly.

The way was open.

Cold night air washed over his face, so cold it burned his lungs. Stars overhead—impossible, beautiful. The forest smelled of pine and wet earth and *freedom*. His eyes watered from the sudden cold.

"Move," Whisper urged, claws digging in. "*Now*, before they realize."

Theron slipped through the broken grate, feet finding purchase on the rocky outcrop beyond—rough stone, still warm from the day's sun, a shocking contrast to dungeon cold. Cold night air hit him like a slap—sharp, clean, *free*. He steadied himself against the cliff face, breathing hard, taking stock of his surroundings. His whole body trembled—cold, exhaustion, adrenaline.

The drainage grate opened onto a steep ravine. Below, perhaps twenty feet down, he could see three possible paths:

**The Forest** — Dense woodland stretched to his left, dark pines and twisted oaks creating a maze of shadows. His phantom thralls were still crashing through there somewhere, confused and angry. But the trees would provide cover. Eventually.

**The Old Road** — To his right, winding down the ravine's edge, a pale ribbon of packed earth caught the moonlight. A road meant civilization. Villages. Help. But roads were also *exposed*. Easy to follow. Easy to track.

**The River** — Directly below, cutting through the ravine's base like a silver scar, black water rushed southward with urgent purpose. He could hear it from here—a constant roar, the sound of violence and speed. Swift, cold, relentless. The spray rose high enough that he could feel the mist on his face, taste the mineral bite of snowmelt.

Whisper's claws tightened on his shoulder.

"Three paths, wizard. Choose quickly. The thralls will realize the deception any moment."

Theron's thumb worked across his fingers—index, middle, ring, pinky—as his mind raced through the options, weighing survival against speed.

"The forest," he said, analyzing aloud. "Provides cover. Multiple concealment points—"

"—and eyes *everywhere*." Whisper's voice was sharp. "Her familiars nest in those trees. Ravens. Owls. Things worse than me. You'd be spotted within a hundred paces. She'd have thralls surrounding you before dawn."

"The road, then. Higher velocity of escape. Distance from her territorial control—"

"Also gets you *seen*. Roads connect. That means travelers. Farmers. Villagers." The rat's whiskers brushed his ear. "And some of them belong to her. Cultists. Informants. You're a wizard in torn robes with no spellbook, running from Thornhollow. How long before word reaches her? An hour? Two?"

Theron stared down at the rushing water. The sound of it filled the ravine—not quite a roar, but close.

"The river," he said slowly, precisely. "You're recommending the water route. Explain your reasoning."

"I'm suggesting the path she won't expect. The one that makes you *invisible*." Whisper's tone was matter-of-fact. "Water masks scent—the thralls track by smell, and you'll leave none. Water muffles sound—no footprints, no broken branches, nothing to follow. And water flows *away*—downstream, toward warmer lands, toward civilization she doesn't control."

"The temperature," Theron pointed out, academic even under duress. "That's snowmelt. I observed it from the cell window—the clarity, the speed. Hypothermia will be as lethal as her thralls."

"Maybe. But cold is *slow*. Thralls are *fast*." The rat shifted, claws pricking through fabric. "You're a wizard. You've survived worse than cold water. And the river runs parallel to the road—you'll see signs of civilization as you go. When you can't stand the cold anymore, climb out. But until then..."

Whisper's voice dropped to barely a whisper.

"The river makes you a ghost. And ghosts are hard to hunt."

Theron looked at each path again. The forest—swarming with her eyes. The road—a trail of breadcrumbs leading right to him. The river—brutal, freezing, but *anonymous*. His fingers found his belt again—still empty. No components. No backup plan. His robes were already damp from dungeon moisture. What was a little more water?

Behind them, distant in the tunnel system, he heard a screech. The thralls had realized. The sound echoed through the ravine, making birds scatter from the trees.

"The river," Theron said, decision made. "Your logic is sound. We proceed with the water route." He was already moving toward the ravine's edge, legs shaky, the descent treacherous. Loose stones skittered beneath his boots, tumbling down toward the churning water below.

"Wisely chosen." Whisper settled into his collar. "Hold your breath when we hit. And wizard?"

"What?"

"Try not to drop me in. I despise being submerged."
