# Chapter 6: Before the Storm

## The Drowned Crow

The tavern was quieter than before. Fewer patrons, more shadows. The afternoon light filtering through the shutters had taken on that golden, heavy quality that came before storms. The air smelled of woodsmoke and simmering stew, warm and comforting. The barkeep—the same flour-dusted woman from Theron's first visit—looked up as he entered, then gave a subtle nod toward the back corner.

The same table where he'd first met Sera and Tomren sat empty, waiting. The wood was scarred and worn smooth by countless hands. Theron made his way over and took a seat with his back to the wall, positioned to watch the door. The bench creaked beneath him.

The barkeep approached without being asked, setting down bread, cheese, and cold meat on a wooden platter. The bread was still warm from the oven, steam rising faintly. She leaned in close enough that he could smell flour and yeast on her apron, voice low.

"Those two you left in the square?" A pause. "Gone. Some folk helped them... leave. Quickly."

She squeezed his shoulder once—brief, careful, her hand warm through his robe—then returned to her bar without another word, her footsteps soft on the worn floorboards.

---

Theron reached for the bread, tearing off a piece while he waited for the others. His left thumb rubbed across his fingertips—index, middle, ring, pinky—a thinking habit he'd never quite broken. The food was simple but warm—exactly what they needed.

Whisper emerged from Theron's hood, whiskers twitching as he surveyed the table. His small nose pointed decisively toward the cheese wedge on the communal platter.

"Is that...?"

"Aged cheddar, I think." Theron broke off a generous piece and placed it on a small wooden plate, sliding it in front of the familiar. "You've earned it."

Whisper approached it with uncharacteristic reverence.

"You didn't have to do this."

"You saved my life. Multiple times. In the span of one night."

"That's... fair." He sniffed the cheese, whiskers trembling. "This is *real* cheese. Not tavern scrapings. Not moldy rind."

"Consider it a down payment. For everything that comes next."

---

The familiar took a small, deliberate bite. His eyes closed.

For a moment, he was not an ancient creature bound by centuries of magical servitude. He was just a small animal enjoying something good.

"You know," Whisper said quietly, "she never fed me. The witch. Not once in forty years. I had to scavenge. Hunt. Steal." He took another bite. "She saw me as a tool. An extension of her will. Not a... partner."

Theron said nothing. He just pushed the plate a little closer.

Whisper ate in silence. So did he.

---

The door opened.

**Tomren** entered first, a heavy pack slung over one shoulder, his crossbow freshly oiled. He nodded at him and claimed a chair, setting the pack down with a solid *thunk*. Without seeming to think about it, he positioned himself at Sera's back, angled toward the door.

"Weapons are ready. Thirty bolts. Four alchemical flasks—two smoke, two fire. Rope. Grappling hook." He paused. "Also bandages. Lots of bandages."

"Optimistic."

"Realistic."

---

**Sera** arrived minutes later, her expression grim.

"The elder didn't believe me. Not fully." She dropped into a seat, rubbing her temples. "I told him Thornhollow was active, that something was coming. He agreed to send runners to the neighboring villages, to *consider* an evacuation. But these people have lived in this valley for generations. They don't flee easily."

"What happens when Szeth-Kaan comes?" Theron asked carefully.

"They won't remember to flee." Her voice was bitter. "That's the problem."

She looked at his new acquisitions—the wand, the pendant, the pouches at his belt.

"Operational parameters. You found what you needed?"

"Enough to make a difference. Maybe." His fingers brushed the empty component pouch at his belt—the one stripped clean by the witch. A reflexive gesture seeking reassurance that wasn't there.

"Maybe is better than nothing." She pulled out the map, now annotated with his earlier additions, her eyes automatically sweeping the room—two exits, three windows, four other patrons. "Let's go over this one more time. Entry points, objectives, contingencies."

---

*The afternoon unfolded in planning.*

**Entry:** The drainage tunnels. He knew the way, and the broken grate remained open.

**Primary objectives:**
1. **Locate Elina** — likely in the dungeons or kept near the ritual chamber
2. **Recover his spellbook and components** — the study, upper level
3. **Disrupt or banish Szeth-Kaan** — the ritual chamber, if possible

**Contingencies:**
- If separated, regroup at the drainage grate
- If overwhelmed, *retreat*—live to fight another day
- If the witch is encountered directly... improvise

"I don't like that last contingency," Tomren muttered. *Click-click-click*—his fingers adjusted the crossbow's tension mechanism, a nervous habit.

"Neither do I," Sera admits. "But we don't know what she's capable of now. Not with that thing bound to her."

She rolled up the map with deliberate care, then looked at each of them in turn.

"We eat. Rest while we can. Storm reaches Thornhollow at 2100 hours. We move at 2030."

---

**The Wait**

Marta brought food without being asked—more stew, fresh bread, a platter of roasted vegetables, and a pitcher of watered wine. She set it down, met Sera's eyes for a moment, and nodded once.

They ate in silence at first. The weight of the coming night sat heavy on the table between them.

Theron found himself studying his companions. Really looking at them for the first time since they fled the village together.

**Sera** — mid-thirties, maybe. The scar on her face was old, from some battle before this one. Her hands, wrapped around her cup, bore calluses from years of sword work. But when she thought no one was watching, her fingers traced the outline of the locket hidden beneath her tunic. Over and over. *Elina. Elina. Elina.*

**Tomren** — older, perhaps forty. Broad-shouldered, steady, with the kind of quiet competence that came from surviving when others didn't. He sat perfectly still, listening to the tavern sounds around them with the focus of a hunter. His eyes kept drifting to Sera. Checking. Making sure she was still there.

"Tell me about her," Theron said quietly.

Sera looked up from her cup. "What?"

"Elina." He paused, choosing his words. "Not the tactical details. Not what the witch might have done. Tell me about *her*. Let me understand who we're fighting for."

Sera's jaw tightened. Her fingers went white-knuckled around her cup, the wood creaking faintly under the pressure. For a moment, he thought she would refuse. The fire crackled in the silence between them.

Then something in her expression softened, the hard lines around her eyes easing.

---

**Elina**

"She was—*is*—" Sera corrected herself fiercely. "She is sixteen. Almost seventeen now." She took a breath. "Smart. Too smart, sometimes. Questions everything. Drove her tutors mad."

A ghost of a smile touched her lips.

"When she was seven, she convinced the village priest that his theology was flawed. Had him second-guessing scripture for *weeks*." Sera shakes her head. "She's always been like that. Curious. Fearless. Thought she could argue her way out of anything."

"Sounds dangerous," Whisper observes from the table.

"She is." Sera's voice is fond despite the fear underneath. "She wanted to be a scholar. Study at one of the academies. She'd save her coin from helping at the market, planning to pay for her own tuition."

Her hand went to her throat, fingers finding the locket chain. The metal was warm from her skin. She pulled it out with trembling fingers, opening it to show the painted portrait. The young woman inside had Sera's sharp features but softer. Younger. Her eyes were bright with intelligence and mischief.

"She used to sing," Sera said quietly, thumb tracing the edge of the portrait. "Badly. Absolutely *terribly*. But she'd sing anyway while doing chores, making up ridiculous lyrics." A pause. Her voice grew thick. "The house has been so quiet since—"

Her voice broke. She pressed her lips together, jaw working as she fought for control. A tear tracked down her scarred cheek despite her efforts.

Tomren's hand found her shoulder, squeezed once. His grip was steady, grounding.

"We'll get her back," he said firmly. "A week from now, you'll be complaining about her singing again."

Sera laughed—a wet, broken sound that was half sob. She wiped her face with the heel of her hand, rough and impatient with her own tears. "Gods, I hope so."

---

**Why Tomren Stays**

Theron looked at Tomren. "You didn't have to come. This isn't your fight."

Tomren took a long drink from his cup. Set it down. Went very still, the kind of stillness that came before difficult truths.

"Sera saved my life three years back at Kren's Crossing. Took an arrow through the lung during the battle—nearly drowned in my own blood."

He traced a scar on his neck, barely visible above his collar.

"Two miles to the nearest surgeon. Sera carried me the whole way, then stayed three days while I recovered." He looked at Sera. "She didn't know me, didn't owe me anything. But she stayed anyway."

Sera shifted uncomfortably. "You would've done the same."

"Maybe. But you did." Tomren's expression was unreadable. "So when you came to me six months ago asking for help with this nightmare—witch, castle, your daughter taken—there was only one answer I could give."

"You could've said no," Theron pointed out.

"Could've. Didn't." Tomren's fingers found his crossbow, adjusting the tension with small, precise movements. *Click-click-click*. "I'm tired of running from things like this. Someone has to stand against the monsters. Might as well be us."

---

**Theron's Search**

Sera turned to Theron. "What about you? You said you came looking for your son. But you haven't told us much else."

"Lucian," he said. The name still hurt, like pressing on a bruise that never healed. "My son. Twenty-two when he vanished. Eight years ago now."

He stared into his cup, watching the wine ripple with the tremor in his hands. The liquid was dark red, the color of blood in firelight.

"He was brilliant. Curious. Always chasing the next question, the next mystery." A bitter smile twisted his lips. "I taught him magic. Theory, technique, control. Thought I'd prepared him for anything." His throat felt tight. He had to force the words out.

What happened?

"He heard rumors. A witch in these parts who could speak to ancient powers, bridge worlds, access knowledge lost to modern practitioners." Theron's hands tightened on the cup. "I told him they were just stories. But Lucian was... persistent. He found books, translated old texts, followed leads I didn't even know existed."

"And then he left," Sera said. Understanding in her voice.

"One morning, just... gone. Left a note saying he'd be back in a few weeks. That was eight years ago." He took a breath, but it caught in his chest. Eight years of searching. Eight years of not knowing. "I searched. Villages, academies, hedge wizards, anyone who might have seen him. Found a pattern—young practitioners vanishing near Thornhollow. All chasing the same rumors." His hands curled into fists on the table.

"You think he found her," Tomren said.

"I think he came here. I found one of his books—margins full of notes in his handwriting. All pointing to Thornhollow, to 'the witch who bridges worlds.'" Theron met their eyes. "Let me be clear. I don't know if he made it to the castle. Don't know if she has him, killed him, or if he died along the way. But she's my only lead. My only chance at answers."

The weight of eight years sat heavy between them, thick as smoke in the warm tavern air. Outside, the first drops of rain began to tap against the shutters.

"That's why you need her alive," Sera said quietly, understanding in her voice. "Not just to stop her. To know."

"To know." The words tasted like ash in his mouth. "Even if the answer is the worst one... I need to know. I've been searching for eight years. I can't stop now. Not when I'm this close." His voice cracked on the last word. He stared at his hands, at the burn scars that marked him as a wizard.

"That's not your fault," Sera said. "Young people chase dangerous things. We can't lock them away."

"Can't I?" The bitterness surprised him. "I knew he was curious. Knew he was fascinated by dangerous magic. I could have forbidden him, hidden the books, *something*—"

"He would've left anyway," Tomren cut in. "Just would've been angrier about it and less prepared for what he found." He shook his head. "Young people make their own choices. We can't stop that."

Sera's voice was soft. "I've spent six months blaming myself for Elina's capture. Thinking of everything I should've done differently. But the truth is—" She stopped. Swallowed. "The truth is, the witch took her. *She* did this. Not me. Not you. Her."

Theron wanted to believe that. Wanted to stop carrying the weight of Lucian's disappearance like a stone in his chest.

"When we get inside," he said quietly, "when we find the witch... if she knows something about what happened to him—"

"You'll get your answers," Sera promised. "Priority one, before extraction. I know what it's like, not knowing."

"Justice or revenge?" Tomren asked quietly.

"Does it matter?"

"Might," Tomren said. "When the moment comes."

Theron thought about that. About Lucian's face the last time he saw him—excited, eager, so sure he could handle whatever he found.

"Let me think..." A long pause. "I'll face that when I have to." Under his breath, barely audible: "*Ignis... fortis... vinculum...*" Fragments of incantations, spoken like prayers.

---

**The Oath**

The rain picked up outside, drumming steadily against the shutters, a low rhythmic beat. The fire crackled, sending sparks up the chimney, bathing the room in warm orange light. The tavern was empty except for them and Marta, who was pretending not to listen from behind the bar, her polishing cloth moving in slow, distracted circles over the same tankard.

Sera pushed her empty plate aside and leaned forward, elbows on the table. She rolled her shoulders once, twice—loosening them, preparing.

"Assess the situation." Her voice was blunt. "We might not survive this. The witch has magic, thralls, that... thing bound to her. We're three people, a rat, and desperation."

"Your recruitment speech needs work," Whisper observed.

Sera ignored him. "But if we do this—if we actually pull this off—we save Elina. We stop whatever the witch is planning. We maybe prevent an entire village from being erased from existence." She looked at each of them. "And if we don't make it out... at least we died doing something that *mattered*."

"Inspiring," Tomren deadpanned. But his expression was serious.

Theron thought about Lucian. About the oubliette on the fourth level, and all those forgotten dead. About what he might find when they go back inside.

"I'm in," he said. "All the way. Whatever it takes."

"Agreed."

Sera pulled out her sword—just an inch, the steel whispering against the scabbard, enough for the blade to catch the firelight and gleam gold and red—and laid her hand on the exposed steel.

"An old soldier's oath," she said, voice steady and ceremonial. "From my garrison days." She looked at them expectantly.

Theron placed his hand on the blade. The metal was cool against his palm, smooth and unyielding. He could feel his pulse against the steel. Tomren added his, his calloused hand settling beside theirs with quiet certainty. Three hands, three lives, touching the same steel.

Sera spoke, her voice steady:

"*By steel and blood, by choice and will,*
*We stand together, come what may.*
*If I fall, you carry on.*
*If you fall, I do not forget.*
*Until the task is done, or we are.*"

She looked at Theron. He repeated the words. Then Tomren, his gruff voice surprisingly gentle.

When they finished, Sera sheathed the blade with a solid *click* of finality. The sound seemed louder than it should be in the quiet tavern.

"There," she said. "Now it's official. We're not just allies. We're *bound*." The firelight caught her eyes, making them shine.

Whisper climbed onto Theron's shoulder. "And what about me? Do I not get to make dramatic pronouncements?"

"You already made your choice," Theron said. "Back in the cell, when you helped me escape."

"True." The rat's whiskers twitch. "Though I reserve the right to reconsider if things get *too* suicidal."

"Fair enough."

---

*Evening fell properly now. The storm arrived with it—rain lashing the windows in sheets, thunder rolling across the valley like drums of war. The temperature dropped, making the fire's warmth more precious.*

---

**Final Preparations**

They moved to their gear in comfortable silence now. The oath had changed something. The air felt different—charged, purposeful.

Tomren distributed the alchemical flasks, showing Theron how the smoke bombs worked ("Pull the pin, throw it, then run."), and Sera took two of the fire flasks, securing them to her belt with practiced efficiency.

Sera checked everyone's armor and weapons with a soldier's thoroughness. She adjusted a strap on Tomren's pack, tightened a buckle on Theron's component pouch.

"Contingency," she said, still focused on the buckle. "If you have to choose between the spellbook and Elina—"

"Elina," Theron said immediately. "Every time."

She looked up, meeting his eyes. Something passed between them. Understanding. Trust.

"Good answer."

---

Whisper surveyed the group from the table, tail twitching.

"You know," he said conversationally, "in forty years of service, I've seen the witch face down challengers before. Wizards. Witch hunters. A paladin once, all shining armor and righteous fury."

"Encouraging," Tomren muttered.

"She killed them all," Whisper continued. "Brutally. Efficiently. Without mercy."

Point?

"The point," Whisper said, "is that none of them had what you have."

"Which is?"

The rat's whiskers twitched. "Something to lose. The paladin fought for duty. The wizards fought for pride. The hunters fought for gold." He looked at each of them. "You three are fighting for something *irreplaceable*. That makes you dangerous in ways she won't expect."

He climbed onto Theron's shoulder, settling into place.

"Also, you have me. Which helps considerably."

Despite everything, Theron smiled.

---

Marta approached their table, wiping her hands on her apron, the fabric worn soft from years of use. She set down a wrapped bundle—the oilcloth crinkling softly.

"Bread, cheese, dried meat," she said gruffly, not quite meeting their eyes. "In case you make it out and need something to eat before you can get back here."

Sera took the bundle, the weight of it solid and real in her hands. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just..." Marta's expression was fierce, jaw tight. "Just come back. All of you. We've lost enough people to that place." Her voice cracked on the last word.

She turned away quickly, but not before Theron saw the moisture in her eyes, the way her shoulders shook.

---

**The Walk to Thornhollow**

Sera stood, her hand automatically adjusting her sword belt, checking the position. The blade sat perfectly at her hip, balanced and ready.

"2030 hours. Time to move."

Tomren shouldered his pack, the weight settling familiar across his back. His crossbow was already loaded, a bolt locked in place. Thirty more waited in his quiver.

Theron touched the wand at his belt. The pendant pulsed against his chest—warm, steady, alive with borrowed power. His component pouch sat heavy but reassuring.

*No. He was not ready. But when had that ever stopped him?*

"Let's go get your daughter," he said to Sera.

She nodded, jaw set with determination. "Adapt. We end a witch."

"And banish an ancient horror from beyond the stars," Whisper added cheerfully. "Don't forget that part."

"Couldn't if we tried."

---

They stepped out into the storm together.

The rain hit immediately—cold needles against exposed skin, soaking through fabric in seconds. The wind whipped at them, carrying the smell of wet earth and distant lightning. Thunder rolled across the valley like a warning, felt as much as heard, vibrating in their chests. Lightning illuminated the distant silhouette of Thornhollow Castle, perched on its hill like a predator waiting, all sharp angles and malevolent towers against the roiling sky. Then darkness again.

But Theron didn't walk alone anymore.

Sera moved to his left, sword hand ready, her boots splashing through puddles forming on the road. Tomren took position on his right, crossbow up, scanning the darkness, rain streaming off the brim of his hood. Whisper clung to his shoulder, tiny claws digging in through wet fabric, warm despite the rain, breath tickling his neck.

*This was it. No more planning. No more preparation. Just the long walk through the storm, toward the castle, toward answers, toward an ending.*

*One way or another.*

---

The road to Thornhollow awaited.
