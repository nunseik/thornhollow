# Chapter 11: Stolen Years

**The Room Falls Silent**

The flames had died to embers. Smoke curled toward the ceiling. The ruined study smoldered around them—centuries of accumulated knowledge reduced to ash and char.

Sera approached slowly, blade still raised, staring at the frozen witch with something between wonder and horror.

"Target status? Is this finished?"

"Almost."

Tomren kept his crossbow trained on her heart. "We could finish this right now. One bolt through the skull would end it."

Whisper crawled down his arm, perching on his wrist, staring at his former master with ancient, unreadable eyes.

"She's bound to Szeth-Kaan," he said quietly. "Killing her might release the binding—or it might *complete* the sacrifice. The entity wanted an ending. A bloodline erased. If she dies with the connection still partially intact..."

"Millhaven vanishes anyway," he finished.

"Possibly. I don't know. No one's ever gotten this far."

---

*The witch's eyes rolled toward him. Pleading? Threatening? It was impossible to tell.*

Theron had her. The most dangerous creature in the valley, frozen at his feet like a statue. Her power was his to claim—or destroy.

But the binding to Szeth-Kaan still lingered. Weakened, yes. Severed temporarily, yes. But not *broken*. The entity still waited beyond the veil, patient as entropy, watching through whatever cracks remained.

---

His right hand moved unconsciously—thumb rubbing across his fingertips in the old pattern. Index. Middle. Ring. Pinky. The gesture he'd developed years ago when faced with impossible choices. Each finger a point of consideration. Each touch a weighing of consequences.

"Stand back," he said quietly. "All of you."

Sera hesitated. "Your intent?"

"Something dangerous. Something necessary." He met her eyes. "If this goes wrong, take Whisper. Find Elina. Extract immediately. No looking back."

"Wizard—"

His fingers found his component pouch, checking its weight by habit. Nearly empty now—most of his reagents spent in the battle above. But enough remained. Always enough for one more spell.

"*Promise me.*"

A long pause. Then she nodded, stepping back, pulling Tomren with her.

Tomren clicked his crossbow's tension mechanism once—a quiet ratchet of sound that spoke of readiness. He positioned himself three steps back, angled to cover Theron without blocking Sera's line of sight. No wasted movement. No hesitation. Just the hunter's instinct, placing himself where he could protect what mattered.

Whisper remained on his wrist, trembling.

"You don't have to do this," he whispered. "There might be another way—"

"Let me think... No. The temporal constraints are absolute. Szeth-Kaan is watching. Waiting. Every second we delay, the binding reknits itself." He looked down at the frozen witch, her terrified eyes locked on his. "She spent centuries accumulating power. Stealing it. Hoarding it. Now it goes to someone who'll actually *use* it for something other than fear."

Theron knelt beside her.

"This is going to hurt. Both of us."

---

He'd read about this. Theoretical texts, forbidden grimoires, warnings scrawled in margins by wizards who attempted it and *failed*. Life force transference. Essence absorption. The magical equivalent of drinking the ocean through a straw.

Most who try are consumed by what they take. The foreign magic overwhelms them, rewrites them, leaves nothing but a hollow shell wearing their face.

But he wasn't most wizards.

Theron drew the gnarled oak wand from his belt—Maren's gift, crude but functional, the rough bark pressing into his palm. He held it in his right hand, letting it ground the wild magic that was about to flow through him, knuckles white with tension. His left hand pressed against the witch's temple, her skin cold and waxy beneath his fingertips, like touching a corpse.

The spellbook at his chest thrummed, vibrating against his ribs like a second heartbeat. The cracked crystal pendant pulsed against his sternum, its unstable resonance humming in anticipation, growing warmer with each beat, almost hot now.

*Warning or encouragement—he couldn't tell.*

His breath came shallow. His heart raced. Sweat dripped down his temple despite the cold.

Theron closed his eyes.

And he *reached* into her mind, into her essence, into three hundred years of stolen life.

---

*Contact.*

---

Her mind crashed into his like a tidal wave, like being hit by a wall of water and stone and centuries of accumulated grief and rage.

*Centuries* of memory slammed into him all at once, overwhelming every sense, drowning thought in sensation—

---

*A child. Ten years old. Braids. Wildflowers clutched in small hands. She was smiling at something beyond the frame, innocent, untouched. The cottage behind her was modest but loved.*

*Then: darkness. Laughter echoing in barn rafters. Friends? No—tormentors. "Weak little Morganna, can't even light a candle." Flames rising—not from her hands. From theirs. Magic she didn't have, used to humiliate. A prank. Just a prank. But the fire caught on dry straw, spread faster than breathing, *engulfed*—*

*Screaming. Her screaming, high and shrill and terrified. Burning. The heat beyond anything imaginable, skin blistering and blackening and peeling, hair igniting like straw, the smell of her own flesh cooking—sweet and horrible, making her gag even as she shrieked. Pain everywhere, consuming, absolute, no thought beyond make it stop make it STOP—*

*Voices in the darkness. Not human. Older. "We can save you, child. But you must give us something in return." She was dying. She agreed. She didn't understand what she was agreeing to.*

*The change. The hunger. The voices wouldn't stop now. They whispered constantly. They wanted. They taught. She learned.*

*Seven figures. Her former friends. Bound in a circle. She was fourteen now, scarred, *different*. They begged. Pleaded. "It was just a joke, Morganna, we didn't mean—" The flames rose. Not an accident this time. Her flames. Deliberate. Righteous. The voices sang approval as her friends burned.*

*The first taste of stolen life. The rush of power. The addiction.*

*Centuries blur—*

---

*Then: a young man. Eager. Brilliant. Dark hair, sharp eyes, carrying translations of Old Texts.*

*"My name is Lucian Ashborne. I've come seeking knowledge."*

*She smiled. They always came willingly.*

---

Theron's eyes snapped open—still in contact, still draining, but *aware* now.

"*You.*" The word came out strangled. "Lucian. You killed my *son*."

Her frozen eyes widened. *Recognition. Understanding. Fear.*

The memories continued—her memories now filtered through his rage—

*Lucian in the ritual circle, drawn in blood and silver. Midnight, new moon. The binding incantations spoken in voices that shouldn't exist. Szeth-Kaan's attention turning toward him like a searchlight of annihilation, focusing, pressing, *judging*. The boy's magical lineage insufficient—she could taste it in his blood, smell it in his essence. Not enough generations. Too raw. Too new.*

*The connection collapsing like a bridge snapping. Lucian convulsing, every muscle seizing, spine arching, fingers clawing at nothing. Blood pouring from his nose in streams, from his eyes like tears, from his ears. His mouth open, screaming, voice breaking: "Father, I'm sorry—Father, I'm—" And then nothing. Just vacant eyes and slack jaw and the smell of voided bowels and death.*

*His death. Cold. Meaningless. His body dragged by thralls. His disposal—dumped like trash in the oubliette, fourth level, bones landing on bones. The sound echoing up the shaft.*

*The journal entry, written an hour later while drinking wine: "Wonder if anyone will come looking for him. They never do."*

---

"*I came.*"

Theron's grip tightened on her temples. The draining intensified—no longer careful, no longer measured. *Rage* fueled it now.

"Eight years I searched. Eight years I *hoped*. And you threw him away like *refuse*."

Her power flooded into him—but now he saw *all* of it. The innocent child she was. The monster she became. The centuries of victims. The bargains. The sacrifices. Lucian was just one of dozens, maybe *hundreds*.

But he was *his*.

"This is for him," Theron whispered.

And he *pulled*.

---

*Theron held—barely.*

---

Pain. *Unimaginable* pain beyond anything he'd ever felt, beyond anything he'd imagined was possible.

Her power flooded into him like molten iron poured into a vessel too small to contain it, like liquid fire in his veins. The wand in his hand grew hot, smoking, the rough bark blackening, the wood beginning to char and split, heat searing into his palm but he couldn't let go, couldn't, needed the anchor. His veins *burned* like lines of fire traced beneath his skin, glowing faintly red through the flesh. His vision whited out, overwhelmed by light and agony and too much, too much—

The pendant at his chest flared white-hot—metal blistering the skin beneath his robe—then *shattered* with a sound like a bell breaking.

Crystal shards burst outward in a spray, cutting through his robes like tiny knives, embedding in his chest, his neck, his jaw. Blood ran hot down his skin. But the pendant's death bought him precious seconds—its final resonance helping channel the overwhelming flood of power just long enough for him to anchor it, to force it into the vessel of himself without being consumed.

Somewhere far away—or maybe right here, he couldn't tell anymore—he heard himself screaming. Raw. Hoarse. Inhuman.

And beneath the pain—*guilt*.

*I'm killing her. Not in battle. Not in self-defense. I'm draining the life from a helpless woman.*

The thought rose unbidden. She was frozen. Terrified. At his mercy. And he was *taking* from her the same way she took from others.

*Does that make me like her?*

His thumb moved against his fingers again. Index. Middle. Ring. Pinky. Each point a question with no clean answer.

No—she murdered innocents. She killed Lucian. She was responsible for decades of suffering.

But he was still taking a life. Deliberately. Coldly.

*Is this justice? Or is this revenge?*

He didn't know. He wasn't sure the distinction mattered anymore.

But he didn't let go.

Theron *pulled*.

---

---

*I am not her. I am not her. I am NOT her.*

The mantra became an anchor—both rejection and plea. Her memories tried to merge with his—her hatreds becoming his hatreds, her fears becoming his fears, her *hunger* seeping into his bones like poison.

For a terrible moment, he understood her. The power. The rush. The intoxicating certainty that *might makes right*.

*No.*

He rejected it. Violently. Pushed back against the seduction of easy answers and stolen strength.

He took the power but left the poison. The magic but not the madness. The essence but not the corruption.

It was the hardest thing he'd ever done.

Harder than escaping the dungeon. Harder than surviving the river. Harder than standing against an entity that erases existence itself.

Because part of him—a small, dark part he didn't know existed—*wanted* to let it in. Wanted to become what she was. Powerful. Feared. *Untouchable*.

*No.*

He held the line between justice and vengeance. Between wizard and monster.

*Barely.*

But he did it.

---

Theron felt the moment it snapped.

Szeth-Kaan's connection to the witch—that ancient, hungry thread stretching between worlds—*severed*. The entity howled across dimensions, its rage echoing through planes he couldn't perceive. It was *so close*. The sacrifice was *almost complete*.

And he stole it.

The witch convulsed beneath his hands, body jerking violently, muscles spasming. Her skin withered like paper held to flame, decades catching up in seconds, centuries of stolen youth fleeing all at once. Wrinkles carved deep into her face, spreading like cracks in porcelain. Her white hair turned brittle as straw, fell away in clumps that dissolved before hitting the ground, carried on wind that wasn't there. Her black-and-starfire eyes faded to milky blindness, the pupils burning out like dying coals until only white remained, then nothing.

She aged. Crumbled. *Ended*.

Not erased—not forgotten—just... finished. A natural death, centuries overdue, finally catching up.

Her body collapsed inward, flesh desiccating, bones turning brittle and hollow. Skin flaked away like ash. In seconds, there was nothing left but a pile of grey dust and the smell of old parchment.

When it was over, only dust remained. And silence.

---

## The Aftermath

Theron collapsed backward, legs giving out, hitting the stone floor hard. Gasping. Trembling. *Alive*.

His body felt like it had been struck by lightning and drowned in ice simultaneously, torn apart and stitched back together wrong. Every nerve screamed in protest. Every muscle spasmed, twitching uncontrollably. His hands shook so badly he couldn't control them. Blood ran from his nose, his ears, the cuts from the pendant shards. His vision swam. His breath came in ragged gasps. But beneath the pain, cutting through the agony like a blade of light, he felt something else.

*Power.* Raw and vast and newly his.

Not hers—not the twisted, hungry magic she accumulated through theft and murder. That he rejected. But the *essence* of what she was—the raw potential, the arcane foundation—that he kept. Refined. Made his own.

**He had absorbed the witch's life force.**

**Level Up.**

His spellcasting felt *sharper*. His connection to the arcane *deeper*. Spells that once required concentration now flowed like breathing. His capacity had *expanded*.

---

Sera was at his side, hauling him upright. Her face was pale, shaken. She rolled her shoulders once—settling weight that wasn't there, a soldier's habit after witnessing something that defied clean categorization.

"You were screaming," she said. "Fifty-two seconds. We thought—"

"I'm okay." He wasn't sure if it was true, but he said it anyway. "I'm okay."

Tomren stared at the pile of dust that was once the Witch of Thornhollow.

"The witch. Is she truly gone?"

"Gone. Truly gone." Whisper's voice was strange—quiet, almost *grieving*. He hopped from Theron's wrist to the floor, approaching the dust, sniffing it once. "Forty years I served her. Hated her. Feared her. And now..."

He was silent for a long moment.

"Now I'm free."

---

**Status Update:**

- **The Witch:** DESTROYED (absorbed, not killed—Szeth-Kaan's binding broken cleanly)
- **Szeth-Kaan:** BANISHED (connection severed; the entity retreats beyond the veil, denied its sacrifice)
- **Millhaven:** SAVED (the village will wake tomorrow, unaware of how close they came to oblivion)
- **Your Party:** Alive, battered, victorious
- **You:** LEVELED UP — new spells available, enhanced capacity, but deeply exhausted

---

Sera gripped his shoulder.

"Elina. Primary objective remains. We need to locate and extract her." Her free hand moved to the locket at her throat, fingers closing around the silver oval. Six months of searching. Six months of carrying this weight. Almost over now.

Theron nodded, forcing himself to stand on shaking legs.

"The tower. That's the most logical location for high-value prisoners. Whisper—can you confirm and guide us?"

The familiar looked up from his former master's remains. Something had changed in his eyes. Something *softer*.

"Yes. I can." He climbed back to Theron's shoulder. "Let's finish this."

---

"Give me thirty seconds to search for supplies," he said, already scanning the wreckage.

---

---

The flames had consumed much, but not everything. The witch had been paranoid—*redundantly* paranoid. Hidden compartments within hidden compartments.

His fingers found a loose stone behind where the cabinet had stood. He pried it free, revealing a small alcove untouched by fire. Inside:

**Three vials**, each glowing faintly with inner light.

- **Crimson vial** — warmth radiates from the glass; the liquid swirls like contained fire
- **Azure vial** — cool to the touch, smelling faintly of mountain air and rain
- **Golden vial** — thick, honey-like, humming with raw magical resonance

Whisper sniffed each one from his shoulder.

"Crimson is a *Potion of Vitality*—purges exhaustion, restores stamina. The azure is a *Potion of Healing*, superior grade. And the golden..." He paused, whiskers twitching. "That's rare. *Elixir of Arcane Restoration*. Replenishes spent spell slots. She must have been saving it for emergencies."

*An emergency like being drained by an upstart wizard, perhaps.*

---

He pocketed the azure and golden vials for later, but drank the crimson one immediately, uncorking it with shaking hands and tilting it back. The liquid was warm, almost hot, tasting of cinnamon and copper and something indefinably magical.

The effect was instantaneous.

Warmth flooded through him—not the burning pain of absorbed power, but something *healing*, like sunlight after days of cold. His muscles unknotted, tension draining away like water. His vision sharpened, the blurriness fading, colors becoming crisp again. The bone-deep exhaustion receded like tide pulling back from shore, leaving him gasping with relief. The cuts from the pendant shards closed, skin knitting together with faint tingles. The trembling in his hands stopped.

He wasn't at full strength. Not truly. But he was *functional*. Battle-ready. Alive.

**Exhaustion cleared. Stamina restored.**

---

Theron also spotted, half-buried beneath a collapsed shelf:

- **A leather journal** — the witch's personal notes, singed but legible
- **A ring of iron keys** — including one that pulsed faintly with enchantment

Theron grabbed all three. The journal alone could contain centuries of research—dark, yes, but *knowledge*. The keys would open whatever cells held Elina and any other prisoners. The scrolls...

*Later. Rescue now.*

---

**Inventory Updated:**

- Potion of Healing (Superior) — saved
- Elixir of Arcane Restoration — saved
- Witch's Journal — acquired
- Ring of Keys (including enchanted key) — acquired
- Sealed Scroll Case — acquired

---

Theron turned to his companions.

"Status: operational. We can proceed."

Sera's eyes flickered with desperate hope. Tomren checked his crossbow one final time. Whisper settled against his neck, a warm and steady presence.

---

**The Tower**

Theron moved through the castle's corridors with new confidence. The witch's servants—those few that remained—*felt* her absence. He passed two cultists fleeing toward the main gates, robes abandoned, faces pale with terror. They didn't even look at him.

The tower staircase spiraled upward, torchlight flickering against ancient stone. Their footsteps echoed in the narrow space. Sera took the lead now, sword drawn, maternal fury propelling her upward. Her hand found the locket again as she climbed—one touch, then another, like counting heartbeats. *Still here. Still looking. Almost there.*

---

**The Tower Prison**

The door at the top was iron-banded oak, locked with three separate mechanisms. He pulled out the ring of keys, trying each until—

*Click. Click. Click.*

The door swung open.

---

The room beyond was circular, ringed with cells—six in total, iron bars corroded with age but still sturdy. The air smelled of straw and despair and something faintly *chemical*. Herbs. Incense. Blood.

Four cells were empty.

One held a man—middle-aged, emaciated, staring at nothing with hollow eyes. He didn't react to their presence.

And the last...

"*Elina!*"

---

Sera rushed forward, falling to her knees before the bars. Her fingers went immediately to the locket, pressing it hard against her chest as if the portrait inside could somehow reach through the metal to touch the living girl beyond.

The cell was small. Maybe eight feet by eight. A thin pallet of straw. A wooden bucket. Nothing else.

On the pallet, curled into herself like a child trying to disappear, trying to take up as little space as possible, was a young woman.

Theron recognized her from the locket portrait—the sharp features, the dark eyes—but six months had left their mark. She was gaunt, skin stretched tight over bone, cheekbones too prominent, hollows at her temples, collarbones jutting beneath a torn shift that might have once been white but was now grey with grime and old bloodstains. Her dark hair hung in tangled mats past her shoulders, greasy and unwashed, clumped together. Her skin was pale, the color of someone who hadn't seen sun in months, marked with bruises in various stages of healing—purple, yellow, green.

But it was the *marks* that made his stomach turn.

Ritual symbols. Painted on her arms in faded ink that had seeped into her skin—circles within circles, geometric patterns that writhed at the edge of his vision, making his eyes hurt to look at directly. Preparation marks. The witch had been *preparing* her for something. Making her *ready*. Some of the symbols were carved into her skin, raised scars forming the patterns.

Her wrists bore rope burns—old ones, partially healed but still angry red, the skin rubbed raw repeatedly. She had been restrained. Often. For long periods.

There were deep hollows under her eyes—not just from malnutrition, but from *sleeplessness*. From fear. From six months of not knowing if each day would be her last, each footstep in the corridor the one that would take her to the ritual chamber.

She didn't move when they entered. Didn't react to Sera's cry. She just stared at the far wall with empty eyes, knees drawn up to her chest, arms wrapped around them, rocking slightly—forward and back, forward and back, a rhythmic motion that suggested hours of this, days, weeks.

*Broken,* Theron thought. *Or close to it.* The dissociation of someone who'd learned that being present hurt too much.

---

"Elina." Sera's voice broke on the name. "It's me. It's your mother."

Nothing. The rocking continued. A soft humming—tuneless, mechanical, a coping mechanism.

Sera's hands gripped the bars so hard her knuckles went white. One hand released, touching the locket again—desperate now, as if the small silver weight could anchor her against the fear that she was too late. "Elina. Look at me. Please."

For a long moment, nothing happened.

Then—slowly, as if waking from a deep sleep—Elina's head turned.

Her eyes focused on Sera's face slowly, like someone waking from a deep sleep. Confusion flickering across her hollow features. Disbelief. Her cracked lips parted. Then—

*Recognition.*

"...Mama?"

The word was a whisper. Hoarse. Raw. The voice of someone who hadn't spoken in days. Maybe weeks. The voice of someone who'd screamed until they had no voice left, then learned silence was safer.

"I'm here." Tears streamed down Sera's scarred face—hot and sudden and unstoppable—the soldier's iron composure shattering completely, crumbling like the witch had crumbled. "I'm here. I located you. Extracting you now." Her voice broke on the last word, barely able to form speech through the tears.

Elina blinked. Once. Twice. As if trying to determine if this was real or just another dream conjured by a starving mind, another hallucination brought on by hunger and fear and hope that hurt too much to hold onto.

"You... came?" Her voice trembled, cracked, barely audible. "I thought... she said you wouldn't. She said no one would. She said—" A sob broke through. "She said I was forgotten. That you'd moved on. That no one was looking anymore—"

"Six months of searching. Every day. Every night." Sera's voice was fierce through the tears, rough with emotion held back for too long. Her hand closed around the locket one final time—squeezing hard enough to hurt, feeling the metal bite into her palm—then released it. She didn't need it anymore. The girl in the portrait was right here. Real. Alive. Breathing. "Never stopped. Never gave up. Not once."

Something broke in Elina's expression. The walls she had built to survive—the dissociation, the numbness, the deliberate *absence*, the protective shell around what little was left—cracked like ice under pressure.

And she *sobbed*. Deep, wrenching sounds torn from somewhere deep in her chest, six months of held-back grief and terror and despair pouring out all at once. Her body shook with it, gasping for air between sobs.

---

Theron stepped forward quickly, pulling out the ring of keys. His own eyes stung. The enchanted one pulsed as he approached Elina's cell—*this one, it said, use me*—and he slid it into the lock with shaking hands. Under his breath, fragments of an unlocking cantrip rose unbidden—"*claudere... aperire... liberare*"—old words, unnecessary for a physical key, but the habit ran deep.

*Click.*

The sound echoed in the stone chamber.

The door swung open.

---

Sera crossed the distance in a heartbeat, falling to her knees beside the pallet, joints hitting stone hard enough to bruise. She reached for her daughter—then hesitated, hands hovering, seeing the marks, the bruises, the carved symbols, the *damage*. Fear in her eyes. *What if I hurt her? What if touch is pain now?*

"Can I—may I touch you?" Her voice was gentle, asking permission, giving control back.

Elina nodded, still crying, unable to speak, just a quick jerk of her head.

Sera gathered her daughter into her arms—gently, carefully, as if she might shatter like glass, like holding something infinitely precious and infinitely fragile. Her hands trembled as she wrapped them around Elina's thin frame, feeling bones too prominent through the shift. Elina clung to her, fingers digging into her mother's armor, face buried in her mother's shoulder, making sounds that weren't quite words—half-sobs, half-gasps, raw animal sounds of pain and relief intertwined. Six months of held-back grief pouring out all at once, soaking into Sera's shoulder.

"I've got you," Sera whispered, rocking her slowly, one hand cradling her daughter's head, the other wrapped around her back. "Secured. Safe now. No one's hurting you again. That's a promise. That's a *promise*." Tears streamed down her face, dripping into Elina's tangled hair.

"She was going to—" Elina gasped between sobs. "—use me for something. A ritual. She kept saying my blood was *right*. That I had what she needed. She kept *marking* me, preparing—"

"It's over. Threat neutralized. She's dead. She can't hurt you anymore."

"Dead?" Elina pulled back slightly, searching her mother's face. "Truly?"

"Confirmed kill. Permanent." Sera looked at Theron. "Thanks to him."

Elina's red-rimmed eyes found him. She stared for a moment—taking in the robes, the spellbook, the residual power crackling around him like St. Elmo's fire.

"Another wizard," she said flatly. Fear flickered across her face.

"Negative. Different classification entirely. He assisted the rescue operation. He's the reason we succeeded."

Theron knelt so he was at her eye level. "My name is Theron. You're safe now. I promise."

Elina studied him with eyes far older than sixteen. "Wizards don't make promises. They make bargains."

*Smart girl,* Whisper observed from his shoulder. *Traumatized, but not broken. She'll survive this.*

"Let me think... Then I'll propose a bargain," Theron said quietly. "The terms are as follows: you walk out of here alive and free, and in return..." He paused. "In return, you survive. You heal. You prove that what she tried to do to you didn't work. That's my price."

Elina blinked. Then, despite everything—despite the marks and the fear and the six months in a cell—a ghost of a smile touched her lips.

"Deal."

---

Tomren appeared in the doorway, carrying a cloak and a waterskin. His gruff expression was suspiciously soft. His stillness spoke volumes—the hunter's awareness that some moments demanded absolute quiet, that movement could shatter fragile things. He cleared his throat.

"Brought supplies. She'll need warmth and water."

Sera wrapped the cloak around Elina's shoulders—warm wool, hiding the marks, the torn shift, the visible damage. Elina drank from the waterskin like someone dying of thirst, then stopped herself, gasping.

"Easy. Slow sips. Your stomach needs time to adjust."

Elina nodded, understanding. She took another small sip, then lowered the skin.

"There are others," she said, voice still hoarse but stronger now. "Not here—in the village. The ones she *turned*. Thralls. They were people once. Farmers. Travelers." She met Theron's eyes. "Can you save them too?"

Theron thought of the jerking, hollow-eyed servants. The ones who tracked by scent, who didn't feel pain, who served without will.

"The thrall condition depends on several variables—duration of transformation, degree of neural degradation, residual connection to the controlling entity. I don't know if reversal is possible," he admitted. "But I'm going to try."

---

Sera helped Elina stand. The girl swayed—six months of minimal movement, minimal food—but she *stood*. Her mother supported her weight without complaint. She adjusted her sword belt with her free hand—a tactical reflex, making sure the blade wouldn't interfere with Elina's movement.

"Mobility assessment. Can you walk?"

"I... I think so. Just slowly."

Tomren shifted to Elina's other side, offering his arm. His positioning was precise—angled to bear weight without restricting mobility, close enough to catch her if she fell. Together, they created a human scaffold—keeping her upright, keeping her moving.

Whisper watched from Theron's shoulder in silence. Through their bond, Theron felt something from the familiar—not quite sadness, not quite joy. Something older. *Recognition.*

*This is what freedom looks like,* the rat whispered. *Hard-won. Painful. But real.*

---

Theron moved to the other occupied cell. The hollow-eyed man didn't respond to the keys, to his voice, to his touch on his shoulder.

"He's been here longer," Whisper said quietly. "Years, maybe. She used him for... experiments. There may not be much left."

"We're extracting all prisoners. No one gets left behind."

Theron hauled the man to his feet. He stood, barely, swaying like a reed in wind. But he *stood*.

---

**Prisoners Rescued:**

- **Elina** — malnourished but coherent; reunited with Sera
- **Unknown Man** — catatonic but ambulatory; requires care

---

As they prepared to descend, Elina spoke—her voice thin, but with an undercurrent of steel that reminded him of her mother.

"There are others. Not here—in the village. The ones she *turned*. Thralls. They were people once. Farmers. Travelers." She met his eyes. "Can you save them too?"

Theron thought of the jerking, hollow-eyed servants. The ones who tracked by scent, who didn't feel pain, who served without will.

"Let me think... The variables are complex—transformation duration, neural integrity, magical contamination. I don't know if restoration is achievable," he admitted. "But I'm going to attempt it."

---

**The Descent**

They made their way down through the castle, a strange procession—a wizard crackling with stolen power, a mother carrying her daughter, a soldier supporting a broken man, a crossbowman watching the rear, and a rat who chose freedom over fear.

The remaining cultists had fled. The thralls wandered aimlessly, their mistress's will no longer guiding them. They didn't attack—they barely *noticed* them.

---

**The Great Hall**

Theron paused here, in the cavernous chamber where the ritual had been performed. Scorch marks scarred the floor in concentric circles. The air still tasted of ozone and wrongness. But Szeth-Kaan's presence was *gone*—truly gone, banished beyond the veil.

Through the tall windows, dawn broke over the valley.

---

Sera set Elina down gently on a stone bench, wrapping her in a salvaged cloak. The girl was already looking stronger—hope did that.

"What's the next move?" Tomren asked, voicing the question everyone was thinking.

Theron looked around the great hall. At the ancient stonework. The vaulted ceilings. The windows overlooking a valley that would wake this morning unaware of how close it had come to oblivion.

He paused, considering the implications, the logistics, the sheer scope of what lay ahead. "Now we begin the reconstruction process. There's significant work to be done."

---
