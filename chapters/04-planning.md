# Chapter 4: The Planning

Sera released his hand and smoothed the map flat against the stone surface, the parchment crinkling softly beneath her palms.

"Now we plan properly." She secured the corners with small rocks—rough stones still warm from the sun—keeping the parchment from curling. "We've been gathering intelligence for weeks, but it's all external. Patrol routes. Supply lines. The castle's silhouette." She tapped the parchment, her fingernail making a sharp sound against the paper. "You're the first person to make it out of there alive and lucid. So."

She slid the map toward him, the paper rasping against stone.

"Show us everything. Entrances. Exits. Guard positions. Where she keeps prisoners. Where she works." Her eyes glinted. "And tell us about this *summoning*. What came through?"

---

## The Layout

*Theron pulled the map closer, studying its edges. Sera's cartography was meticulous—the castle's exterior, the treeline, the river he knew all too well. But the interior was blank. Waiting.* His left thumb moved across his fingertips in sequence—index to pinky, then back again—as he considered where to begin.

"Do you have charcoal? A quill?"

Tomren produced a stick of graphite from his pack, the charcoal leaving dark smudges on his fingers. Theron took it—the graphite smooth and cool—and began to sketch.

He traced a preliminary line on the parchment, the graphite scratching softly. "The castle has three levels that I know of. Possibly more."

His hand moved across the parchment, roughing in shapes from memory. The smell of graphite mixed with the forest scents around them—pine and moss and stream water.

"The dungeons are the lowest. Cells here, here, and here." He marked Xs. "Mine was the third on the left. Stone walls, iron bars, old but solid. There's a central corridor that runs the length of the dungeon, lit by torches that never seem to burn out."

"Enchanted?" Sera asked.

"Almost certainly."

Theron traced a line downward.

"Below the main dungeon level, there's a drainage system. Old tunnels—pre-dates the castle, I think. This is how I escaped." He marked the grate's position. "The ironwork was rusted. One of her thralls broke it down chasing an illusion."

A faint smirk from Tomren.

"The tunnels branch extensively. Without a guide, you'd be lost within minutes. Some passages are collapsed. At least one leads to an oubliette—Whisper warned me away from it."

The familiar spoke up from his shoulder. "Deep pit. Old bones at the bottom. She throws failures down there."

Sera's jaw tightened, muscles jumping beneath her scarred cheek. Her hand moved unconsciously to the locket at her throat, gripping it. She was thinking of Elina. When she breathed, it came out shaky.

---

Theron continued, sketching upward now.

"Above the dungeons, a spiral staircase connects to what I believe is the main level. I didn't see it directly, but I heard the ritual coming from above. The acoustics suggest a large central chamber—great hall, perhaps, or a converted throne room."

"That's where she'd work," Whisper added. "She likes theatrical spaces. Room for circles. Altars. Audiences."

"What kind of audiences?" Tomren asked.

"She talks to *something*. Always has. Whether it listens..." The rat shrugged, disturbingly human. "Who knows?"

Theron marked the probable location of the ritual chamber.

"Her study is somewhere on this level as well. That's where my spellbook will be—she'd want to examine it, learn what I know. Witches covet other practitioners' secrets."

"And the component pouch?" Sera asked.

His hand moved reflexively to his belt, reaching for the familiar weight—but found only empty leather loops. The absence felt like a missing tooth. "On her person. She was wearing it when I heard her voice from above."

---

## The Defenses

Theron set down the graphite and leaned back.

"Thralls. At least three, possibly more. Human once—or close enough. They move wrong. Jerky, like puppets with tangled strings. They don't speak, but they *track*. By scent, I think. Maybe sound."

"Can they be killed?" Tomren asked, hand resting on his crossbow. His fingers found the tension mechanism—*click-click-click*—adjusting it with practiced precision.

"What do you mean by 'killed'?" Theron asked. "They're not undead, if that's what you're asking. They bleed. A bolt to the head would put one down, I'd wager." He paused. "But they're *fast* when they want to be. And they don't seem to feel pain."

Sera nodded grimly. "We've dealt with enthralled before. Standard suppression tactics—immobilize the legs, then neutralize."

Theron continued.

"There's also her familiar network. Or there *was*." He glanced at Whisper. "She keeps eyes and ears throughout the castle. Rats, ravens, spiders—small creatures bound to her will. They report back. If one sees you, she knows."

"Present company excluded," Whisper said drily.

"Can you identify the others?" Sera asked the rat directly.

"Some. Not all. She's had centuries to build her web." Whisper's whiskers twitched. "But I know which ones are truly loyal and which are merely... *bound*. There may be opportunities for misdirection."

Sera absorbed this. "Threat assessment—magical defenses? Wards? Alarms?"

"The silver key," he said. "In the dungeon, there were three keys. One opened my cell. One—the silver one, with runes—triggers an alarm if used. I don't know what the bone-white key does, and I didn't ask."

Tomren grunted approval.

"Assume wards on every significant entrance. The main doors, her study, the ritual chamber. I can't tell you specifics without examining them, but a witch of her power wouldn't leave herself exposed."

---

## The Summoning

The forest around them felt colder suddenly, despite the afternoon sun. The stream seemed quieter. Even the birds had gone silent, as if sensing the weight of the conversation.

"I didn't see it directly," he admitted, throat tightening at the memory. "I was in the tunnels when it happened. But I *felt* it." His hands trembled slightly.

Theron searched for words adequate to the memory. Under his breath, barely audible: "*Praesidium... fortis animus...*" Fragment of a warding incantation, unconscious comfort.

"The chanting stopped. Then—a sound. Like reality being torn. Fabric ripping, but *deeper*. It resonated in my bones, my teeth. Made them ache." He shook his head, rubbing his jaw at the phantom pain. "And then her voice changed. Layered. As if something else was speaking *through* her. Or *with* her."

Sera's face had gone pale, the scar standing out livid against her skin. She gripped the stone table edge, knuckles white.

"What did it say?"

"'The binding is complete. Now... where is my sacrifice?'"

Silence.

Tomren's hand tightened on his crossbow.

"She's bound something," he continued. "Something powerful enough to require a sacrifice. Something that can speak through her." He looked at Whisper. "Do you know what it might be?"

The familiar was quiet for a long moment.

"She's been researching for decades. Collecting texts. Obsessing over old names." His voice was unusually subdued. "There were three entities she spoke of most often. Three she believed could be bound, if the price was paid."

He met his eyes.

"**Vaelthar the Unraveler**—a demon of entropy. It consumes magical bonds, unweaves enchantments. Dangerous to casters, but relatively containable."

"**Morreth, the Choir of Wounds**—not one being but many, fused together. It speaks with borrowed voices and feeds on pain. Harder to kill because there's no single point of failure."

"Or..."

Whisper hesitated.

"**Szeth-Kaan, the Herald of Empty Thrones.**"

Even the name felt wrong in his ears, tasted bitter on his tongue. The temperature seemed to drop. Sera shivered visibly, arms wrapping around herself.

"What is that?" she asked, voice smaller than before.

"Old. Very old. A thing from before the gods carved their names into the world. It doesn't want worship. It doesn't want souls." Whisper's voice dropped to a whisper. "It wants *endings*. Kingdoms. Bloodlines. Legacies. It erases things from history so completely that no one remembers they existed."

The fire crackled.

"If she's bound Szeth-Kaan..." The familiar trailed off. "Then the sacrifice isn't a person. It's a *place*. A village. A family line. Something with roots."

Sera's hand moved to the locket at her throat, fingers trembling as they found the chain.

---

The forest sounds seemed distant, muffled. Theron could hear his own heartbeat, loud in his ears.

Sera spoke first, her voice rough.

"Then we don't have weeks. We might not even have days." She looked at him. "Can you tell which one it is? From what you heard?"

*Theron closed his eyes, reaching back into the memory. The sound. The voice. The way the air tasted—ozone and old blood.*

"The layered voice," he said slowly. "It wasn't a chorus. It was singular, but *fractured*. Like one speaker echoing through broken mirrors."

Whisper nodded. "That rules out Morreth. The Choir speaks in true multiplicity—dozens of voices at once, overlapping. What you heard was one entity, fragmented."

"And the feeling when it arrived. Not unraveling. Not dissolution." He pressed his palm flat against the stone, remembering. "It felt like *erasure*. Like the space where the ritual happened was being... edited. Removed from the world's memory even as it occurred."

Sera's face had gone ashen.

"Szeth-Kaan," Whisper confirmed, his voice barely audible. "The Herald of Empty Thrones."

---

Tomren broke it, his gravelly voice cutting through the dread.

"So we're fighting a witch and some ancient god-thing. Wonderful."

"Not a god," Whisper corrected. "Older than gods. Gods have egos, desires, worshippers. Szeth-Kaan is more like... a function. A cosmic editor. It removes things that have grown too *loud* in the weave of history."

"And the witch summoned it *why*?" Sera demanded.

"Power. Revenge. Immortality." The familiar shrugged. "The usual reasons. But Szeth-Kaan doesn't grant wishes. It makes *bargains*. She must have offered it something it wanted."

"The sacrifice," he said. "A place. A bloodline."

His eyes met Sera's.

"Millhaven."

---

The word fell like a stone into still water.

Sera rose abruptly, boots scraping against stone. She moved away from the map, staring through the trees toward where Millhaven lay hidden—the farmers starting their day, children running past, smoke rising from chimneys. Her breathing was ragged, fists clenched at her sides.

"How long?" she asked without turning.

Whisper calculated. "The binding is complete, but Szeth-Kaan doesn't act immediately. It savors. Studies. Learns the shape of what it will erase." A pause. "Three days, perhaps. Maybe less if she's accelerating the process."

"Three days to stop a witch and a primordial entity." Tomren's voice was flat.

---

## The Disagreement

Sera turned back to face them, and the grief in her eyes had hardened into something sharper. Purpose. She rolled her shoulders once—a fighter's reflex before confrontation, joints popping softly.

"My daughter is in that castle. This village—these people—they're in the operational area." She planted both hands on the map, palms flat against the stone, the impact making a solid thump. Her eyes scanned automatically: trees for cover, the stream for retreat, angles of approach. "We're not waiting. We're not scouting further. We move at nightfall."

Tomren's expression darkened, jaw setting. "That's suicide with what we have."

"It's operational necessity." Sera's voice was steel, but Theron could hear the tremor beneath it. "Every hour we delay, Szeth-Kaan gets stronger. Every hour, Elina—" Her voice caught, breath hitching. "We don't *have* time to wait."

"We don't have the *resources* to rush," Tomren countered, his usual calm fraying at the edges. "We need better equipment. More intelligence. Maybe we find other hunters, build a proper strike team—"

"There's no time for that!" Sera's voice rose, echoing through the forest. Birds scattered from nearby trees. "While we're building your strike team, that thing erases Millhaven from existence. Elina disappears. Everyone here *forgets they ever lived*."

If we die unprepared, everyone dies. Your daughter included.

The tension cracked like lightning between them. The air felt charged, dangerous. Tomren's hand had drifted toward his crossbow. Sera's fingers brushed her sword hilt.

Theron raised a hand, palm out. "Both of you. Stop."

They turned to him, breathing hard, chests heaving. The stream burbled in the sudden silence.

Theron's voice was measured, precise. "Tomren's right that we need to be smart about this. But Sera's also right that we're on a clock. The question isn't *whether* we go tonight—it's *how* we go." He looked between them. "We have hours, not days. So we use those hours wisely. Gather what we can. Plan properly. Then move."

Sera's jaw worked, grinding audibly. Her hand released the sword hilt with visible effort. She nodded stiffly.

Tomren exhaled slowly, a long breath that seemed to release the tension from his shoulders. "Then we need a real plan."

"Agreed." Theron pulled the map closer. "Which brings us to the harder question."

"Which is?" Sera asked.

"What exactly do you mean by 'primary objective'?" He looked at each of them. "Because I see three goals here, and they might not be compatible."

---

## Conflicting Priorities

The weight of the question hung heavy between them.

Sera spoke first, voice tight. "Elina. We find her, we get her out. That's why I'm here."

"And alert the witch? Trigger every alarm in the castle?"

"Then we fight through it."

"Then we die." Tomren shook his head, going utterly still as he absorbed the strategic implications. A hunter listening to the forest. "We blow our surprise, we're dead. The ritual continues anyway."

"Don't." Sera's voice was dangerous. "Don't tell me to sacrifice my daughter for 'the greater good.'"

"We need to prioritize the threats." Tomren leaned forward. "Biggest threat is Szeth-Kaan, not the witch. Disrupt the binding first, then extract the girl."

"By which time she could be dead!" Sera's hand moved to her sword hilt, adjusting its position on her belt with practiced tension. "Or worse—used as a sacrifice."

Theron cleared his throat. "There's also the matter of my spellbook."

They both turned to stare at him.

"Your *spellbook*?" Sera's voice was incredulous. "That's your priority right now?"

"Hear me out." Theron kept his voice level. "I'm operating at maybe ten percent of my capability. Cantrips and tricks. Against a witch who has decades of experience and a bound demon?" He shook his head. "I'm barely useful. But if I can recover my spellbook—if I can get even a few minutes to study and prepare proper spells—I could be the difference between victory and everyone dying."

"He's not wrong," Whisper added from his shoulder. "A prepared wizard is worth ten armed soldiers in a fight like this."

"That's a delay we can't afford," Tomren pointed out. "How long to find it? How long to search through traps?"

"Then I deal with the traps. That's what wizards do." Theron met Sera's eyes. "I'm not saying abandon Elina. I'm saying if we go in there with me at a fraction of my power, we're more likely to *fail* to save her."

Sera's expression was anguished. "So what, we leave her in a cell while you browse through books?"

"Twenty minutes," Theron said. "Maybe less if the study isn't heavily trapped. And in exchange, you get a wizard who can actually contribute to the fight."

The silence was heavy.

Whisper spoke up quietly. "There's also the matter of *information*. Theron's spellbook might have notes. Records. Details about—" He glanced at Theron. "About previous visitors to the castle. People the witch has... processed."

Theron's throat tightened. Lucian. Whisper was talking about finding evidence of Lucian.

Sera saw it on his face. "This isn't just about power. You want answers."

"I want both." Theron didn't flinch from her gaze. "And yes, if there's a chance—even a slim one—that I can learn what happened to my son, I'm taking it. But that doesn't change the tactical reality. We *need* my spellbook if we're going to win."

---

## The Compromise

Tomren rubbed his face with both hands. "Three objectives. Rescue the girl, recover the spellbook, stop the ritual." He looked up. "Against thralls, a witch, and a bound entity. All in maybe three hours."

"We split up," Sera said.

"No." Tomren's response was immediate. "That's how people die."

"Then we *choose*," Sera interrupted. "What comes first. What's most important."

The question hung between them like a blade.

"Let me think through this tactically." His thumb moved across his fingertips again—index, middle, ring, pinky—each contact point marking a variable in the equation. The drainage tunnels came up near the dungeons. Elina was likely imprisoned there. His spellbook was in the study, which was probably on the main level. The ritual chamber—where Szeth-Kaan was summoned—was also main level, possibly higher.

"We can't do everything at once," he said slowly. "But we can sequence it smart. Use the castle's layout to our advantage."

He traced the map with one finger.

"We enter through the drainage tunnels. That puts us near the dungeons. We move fast, quiet. Find Elina, extract her. Get her *out* through the tunnels before we proceed."

"That's—" Sera started.

"I'm not finished." Theron continued. "Once she's safe—truly safe, outside the castle—Tomren escorts her to a fallback position. Maybe the forest's edge. Somewhere she can hide or run if things go wrong."

"Two of us against a witch and a demon?" Tomren's skepticism was palpable.

"No. You come back. But Elina is *secured* first. Not just rescued—*secured*. Extraction complete before we proceed." He looked at her. "You'll fight better knowing she's out. Won't you?"

Sera's jaw worked. Her thumb found the locket at her throat, tracing its outline once. Then she nodded reluctantly. "Affirmative."

"Then we move to the study. I retrieve my spellbook, prepare what I can. Fifteen minutes, tops." He met her eyes. "And if I find information about Lucian, I pocket it and keep moving. No delays."

"Can you do that?" she asked quietly. "If you find out your son died there—can you set it aside and keep fighting?"

The question cut deep. Theron thought about the oubliette. The bones at the bottom. The very real possibility that Lucian was among them.

"I've been searching for eight years," he said finally. "Eight years of not knowing. If I find proof—even the worst proof—at least I'll *know*." He straightened. "And knowing will free me to finish this properly. No more wondering. Just purpose."

Tomren grunted. "That's... surprisingly healthy for someone about to storm a nightmare castle."

"Or completely delusional," Whisper added. "But I appreciate the commitment."

Sera was watching Theron with new respect. "After the study. Then what?"

"Then we find the ritual chamber. Together, all three of us." Theron tapped the map where he'd marked the probable location. "We disrupt whatever the witch is doing. Banish Szeth-Kaan if we can, weaken it if we can't. And we end her."

He looked between them.

"Does that work? Can you live with that sequence?"

Tomren considered, then nodded. "Not perfect. But it's a plan."

Sera's hand moved to the locket at her throat. Her fingers traced its outline—once, twice.

"Elina first," she said. "Secure the extraction, establish a rally point. Then I don't care if we have to fight every demon in the Nine Hells." Her eyes were fierce. "I'll burn that castle down brick by brick."

"That's the spirit," Whisper said approvingly. "Pyromania always helps."

---

Theron felt the tension ease slightly. The air no longer crackled with potential violence. Sera's shoulders dropped a fraction. Tomren's hand moved away from his weapon.

She looked at him.

"You said you're a fraction of yourself without your spellbook. Can you still fight? Can you still *help*?"

---

Theron had cantrips. Minor Illusion. Message. Prestidigitation. Light. Mage Hand. Perhaps one or two others rattling around in his memory. No components. No focus. No prepared spells beyond what was burned into his mind.

But he also had Whisper—a familiar who knew the castle's secrets. He had knowledge the others lacked. And he had three days of fear and humiliation crystallized into something cold and determined.

*Theron rose to his feet, matching Sera's resolve.*

"I can fight. I'll need to be creative—but then again, I always do." He allowed himself a thin smile. "I've survived worse odds than this. Three days ago I was in chains. Now I'm planning an assault."

Sera's eyes flickered with something like approval.

"But," he continued, "I won't go to war empty-handed. Not if I can help it. Even basic components would double my effectiveness. A focus would triple it." He gestured back toward where Millhaven lay hidden through the trees. "Is there an apothecary in the village? An herbalist? Even a hedgewitch with a cluttered shelf?"

Tomren grunted. "Old Maren, near the chapel. She's eccentric, but she's the real thing."

"Real is all I need."

Sera rolled up the map with decisive movements, the parchment crinkling loudly in the quiet. "Then we return to Millhaven. Maintain operational security. Get you supplied. Then we move on Thornhollow." She met their eyes, her gaze steady now, resolved. "We have three to four hours before nightfall. That's our window."

"And the cultists?" Theron asked. "The ones who saw us leave?"

"They're reporting back to the witch," Tomren said grimly. "She already knows we're coming."

"Good." Sera's smile was sharp and cold. "Let her prepare. Let her worry. We're coming anyway."

---

## The Return

Theron looked back toward the direction of Millhaven, hidden beyond the trees.

"Those cultists who saw us—they'll report back to the witch. She'll know we're coming."

"Let her know," Sera said, rolling up the map with sharp, decisive movements. "We're not hiding anymore."

"But we don't go in blind." Tomren checked his crossbow, fingers moving through familiar motions. *Click-click-click* went the tension mechanism as he made minute adjustments. A low hum started in his throat—barely audible, a thinking sound. "We get supplies, components. A proper meal first."

Theron nodded. "There's an apothecary in Millhaven—Maren's. I'll need spell components if I'm going to be any use in there. And a focus, if she has one."

"We go back together," Sera said firmly. "Get what we need, rally at The Drowned Crow for final prep." Her hand moved to the locket at her throat. "Then we move on Thornhollow at nightfall."

The plan settled between them—not perfect, but *real*. Achievable.

"Watch for cultists in the village." Tomren positioned himself slightly behind Sera's left shoulder—the familiar place, her blind side covered.

"Then we deal with them if we have to." Sera's expression was hard. "We're not delaying because of a few hired knives. The clock is running, and Elina doesn't have time for us to be cautious."

---

*They moved through the forest with purpose now, looping wide around Millhaven's eastern approach. The village came into view through the trees—quiet, unaware of the storm gathering.*

*First, the apothecary. Then the tavern. Then Thornhollow.*

---
