# Chapter 9: The Wait

Theron said quickly, his mind racing through possibilities, adrenaline sharpening his thoughts. "We're not running. We're *hunting*."

Sera's eyebrow rose, scarred face skeptical. "Sitrep. Now."

"She's coming here. Right now." He was already moving, boots scraping on stone, pulling components from his pouch—fleece, salt, powdered silver. His fingers fumbled slightly with urgency. "She expects to find intruders fumbling through her wards—instead, she'll find an empty room, exactly as she left it. The cognitive dissonance will force her to second-guess herself. Lower her guard. And when she does..."

Theron bared his teeth in something that wasn't quite a smile, more grimace than grin.

"We spring the trap."

Sera exchanged a glance with Tomren. The soldier's jaw tightened, but he nodded.

"High risk," Sera said. But she was already checking her blade, positioning herself. "Contingency plan?"

"If it doesn't work, we were dead anyway. Let me be precise about this—" Theron's hands moved through component pouches with practiced precision. "At least this way, we control the variables. We choose the ground."

## Phase One: The Illusion

Theron reached for the fleece in his component pouch—*Major Image* requires concentration, but the payoff is worth it.

"Everyone against the walls. Complete stillness is essential—even breathing needs to be minimal."

Sera and Tomren flattened themselves into the shadows behind the door. Theron positioned himself behind the bookshelf, line of sight to the pedestal.

Then he cast, fingers moving through practiced gestures, fleece crumbling between his fingers.

The incantation whispered through his lips, each syllable precise, tongue and teeth shaping sounds older than language. The weave of the spell built in his mind's eye—threads of illusion, light, and perception woven together like a tapestry, each strand needing perfect tension. He could feel it taking shape, the magic responding to his will, warm and electric under his skin. He'd practiced this spell a thousand times, but never with this much at stake. His heart pounded. Sweat beaded on his forehead.

The room shimmered like heat haze and *settled*. Where the pedestal stood empty, his spellbook now appeared—a perfect replica, leather gleaming with the exact pattern of wear, silver clasp catching the torchlight at the precise angle. The cabinet doors closed themselves with barely a whisper of wood on wood. The dust redistributed across surfaces with a faint sigh, settling into the exact patterns they'd disturbed. Every sign of their presence erased itself like words wiped from a slate, backwards through time.

Even the scorch marks from the fire Theron had started returned, perfectly mimicking how the room had looked before they'd disturbed it.

"Impressive," Whisper murmured from deep within his hood.

"I'm just getting started."

## Phase Two: Mirror Image

Theron whispered the incantation, feeling the magic split and refract. Three illusory duplicates shimmered into existence around him, each one perfect, each one moving with his breath.

*Four targets. One real. Good luck, witch.*

## Phase Three: The Wait

Silence fell.

Theron pressed his back against the bookshelf, feeling the ancient wood dig into his spine, sharp edges of the shelving biting into his shoulder blades. His breath came shallow and controlled—years of meditation practice keeping his chest from rising visibly, each inhale measured and silent. The mirror images around him mimicked the stillness perfectly, breathing when he breathed.

In the dungeon, he'd had nothing but time. Hours stretching into days, fear dulled by routine and exhaustion, the ache becoming familiar. But this—this was *active* terror. Knowing she was coming. Knowing that in moments, he'd face someone who had casually captured him, drained dozens of victims, and bargained with demons for centuries of life. His pulse thundered in his ears. His throat felt tight.

*What made him think he could win?*

His teacher's voice echoed in memory: *"Doubt before battle is wisdom. Doubt during battle is death. Know which you're in."*

He forced the thought away with effort, jaw clenching. Focused on the plan. On the spellbook he'd recovered—warm against his chest, a solid weight. On the friends hiding in the shadows with him, trusting him to get this right. Trusting him with their lives.

*Don't think. Just wait.*

The storm raged outside, rain hammering the windows, lightning illuminating the room in staccato bursts of white brilliance. Thunder rolled across the valley, shaking the castle's foundations, vibrating through the stone walls and floor. Each flash threw harsh shadows across the room, making the illusory spellbook gleam with false promise.

Minutes crawled past like hours, each second distinct and agonizing.

Theron's legs began to ache from standing motionless—first the calves cramping, then his thighs burning, then his lower back seizing up. The bookshelf edge dug deeper into his spine. His concentration wavered—maintaining the *Major Image* required constant focus, a background hum of magic threading through his mind that couldn't slip even for a moment, draining his mental reserves drop by drop. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cold, running into his eyes, stinging, but he couldn't wipe it away. His nose itched. A muscle in his calf twitched, threatening to spasm.

Across the room, barely visible in the darkness, Sera hadn't moved. But he could see the tension in her shoulders, the white-knuckled grip on her sword. She'd been hunting this witch for six months. All that rage, all that fear for Elina—compressed into this single moment of stillness.

If this went wrong, they'd die here. All of them.

Whisper trembled against his neck, the familiar's body pressed flat against his skin beneath his robes.

"Second thoughts?" the rat whispered, voice barely audible even in the silence.

*So many.*

"Too late for that," Theron breathed back.

"She's close. Very close. And she's not alone."

The air pressure changed. Theron felt it before he heard anything—a *weight* descending on the castle, like storm clouds gathering directly overhead, pressing down on his chest and shoulders, making it harder to breathe. The magic in the walls bent and flexed, responding to her presence the way metal shavings align to a lodestone. The temperature dropped five degrees in an instant. The hairs on his arms stood up. His breath misted white.

She was coming.

His heart hammered against his ribs, so hard it hurt, so loud he was certain she'd hear it. The spell flickered—just for an instant, the illusory spellbook wavering like a mirage—before he clamped down on his concentration with desperate force, sweat now pouring down his temples.

"Cultists?" he whispered, barely a breath, lips barely moving.

"One. Maybe two. And..." Whisper paused, body going rigid against his neck. "Something else. Something that doesn't breathe."

*Szeth-Kaan's influence. A manifestation. Or worse.*

The air tasted wrong now—metallic and cold, like licking copper in winter.

Sera's hand tightened on her sword, knuckles white in the darkness. Tomren raised his crossbow with agonizing slowness, the wood creaking so softly only they could hear, finger resting beside the trigger. The soldier's breathing had gone perfectly silent—a trick Theron had only seen from trained hunters, breath held in the lungs without strain.

Footsteps echoed in the corridor, muffled by stone but growing louder.

Not hurried. Not cautious. *Confident*. The measured pace of someone walking through their own domain, expecting no resistance, fearing nothing.

Getting closer. Each footfall distinct, unhurried, inevitable.

Theron's mind raced through the plan. Sera would strike first—she was closest to the door. Tomren's bolt would take the second cultist. Theron's illusions would confuse, and then—

*And then we hope we're fast enough.*

The footsteps stopped outside the door.

Time crystallized. Each heartbeat distinct and separate. Each breath a conscious choice.

This was it. No more planning. No more doubt.

The door would open, and everything would happen at once.

**The Door Opens**

She entered like a queen surveying her domain, movements fluid and wrong.

The Witch of Thornhollow was tall—impossibly so, nearly seven feet, as if her bones had been stretched by centuries of dark magic, proportions subtly inhuman. Her hair was white and wild, cascading past her waist in tangled waves that moved as if in unseen wind. Her skin had the pallor of something that hadn't seen true sunlight in decades—not pale, but *bloodless*, like marble or corpse flesh, stretched too tight over angular bones. She smelled of ozone and old blood and something floral that had rotted. And her eyes...

Her eyes were *wrong*. Black where they should be white, like pools of ink, with pupils that burned like dying stars—pinpoints of red light in the darkness. Looking at them made Theron's stomach turn, made his vision blur at the edges, made every instinct scream *run*.

Around her neck, Theron saw it: **his component pouch**. Worn like a trophy on a leather cord, swaying with her movements, just as Whisper had said. The sight sent a spike of rage through his chest—hot and fierce—quickly suppressed with effort. Emotion was luxury. Control was survival. But his jaw clenched. His fingers tightened.

Behind her stood two robed cultists, faces hidden beneath deep hoods, the fabric stained and rank. And between them, floating a foot off the ground, was a *shape*—humanoid but hollow, a silhouette cut from reality itself, edges flickering like a candle flame in wind. The air around it rippled and bent. Looking at it hurt, made his eyes water, made his head pound. It didn't cast a shadow. It made no sound.

Cold washed over Theron like ice water, making him shiver despite his efforts at stillness. He'd read about such things—anchors for demonic consciousness, allowing them to manifest partially in the material plane. It shouldn't be possible without a full ritual circle, without sacrifices, without—

The witch surveyed the room, those burning eyes sweeping across every surface. Her gaze passed over the illusory spellbook, the undisturbed cabinet, the empty shadows where they hid. Theron could feel her attention like a physical weight, pressing against his skin, searching.

Theron held his breath until his lungs burned. Didn't blink, eyes going dry and stinging. Didn't move, muscles locked, cramping.

*One chance. If she sees through the illusion—*

She frowned, perfect face creasing.

"Nothing," she murmured, her voice layered with that same fractured resonance Theron remembered from the dungeon—multiple voices speaking in unison, human and not. "The wards triggered, but nothing is disturbed..." Her head tilted, listening to something they couldn't hear.

One of the cultists shifted nervously, robes rustling. "Perhaps a malfunction, Mistress? The storm—"

"My wards do not *malfunction*." The words were sharp, cutting, carrying the threat of violence.

But uncertainty flickered across her face, a crack in the mask. She stepped further into the room, boots clicking on stone, moving toward the pedestal. Toward the illusion of his spellbook. Her hand extended, pale fingers reaching.

*Closer. Just a little closer.*

Lightning flashed outside, brilliant white, illuminating the entire room for a split second. Thunder followed immediately, rattling the windows in their frames, shaking dust from the ceiling.

Her hand reached out—long fingers with nails filed to points, scarred with ritual marks—inches from the illusory book—

**Now.**

Theron released the breath he'd been holding, lungs aching, and let the magic *surge* through him like a flood breaking a dam.
