# Chapter 10: The Battle

"Execute—NOW!"

His hand thrust forward, the bat guano and sulfur igniting between his fingers with a burst of heat that seared his palm. The incantation tore from his throat, raw and primal, every syllable burning. A bead of orange light streaked across the room, leaving tracers in his vision, the air hissing—

And *bloomed* like a second sun.

---

**FIREBALL**

**damage.**

---

The study *exploded* in flame and fury and brilliant orange light.

The heat hit first—a wall of searing air that flash-burned exposed skin, that made lungs gasp and eyes water. Books ignited instantly, pages curling black, centuries of knowledge consumed in seconds. Alchemical vials shattered in the heat and added their contents to the inferno—green flames mixing with orange, chemicals hissing and popping. The smell was overwhelming—burning paper and leather, sulfur, mercury vapor, cooked flesh. The cultists screamed—high and shrill and inhuman—as their robes caught fire, as flesh blistered and blackened and peeled. The shockwave hurled them backward like ragdolls, robes streaming fire. One slammed into the wall with a wet crunch and didn't rise, skull cracking against stone. The other staggered, burning like a living torch, flailing blindly, still screaming, the sound cutting through the roar of flames.

The witch shrieked—not in pain, but in *rage*, voice cracking with fury. The flames licked at her robes, her hair, making her glow like something from hell, but she was warded against fire. Of course she was. Centuries of paranoia made manifest in protective enchantments.

But she was *distracted*, her concentration broken, her certainty shattered.

The illusion shattered. She saw the empty pedestal now, understood the deception, and her black-and-starfire eyes snapped toward his position—

"*You!*" Her voice cracked like thunder. "The escaped rat. The *clever little prisoner*." She laughed, wild and sharp. "Did you think I wouldn't find you? That you could hide in *shadows* from me?"

Her hands rose, dark energy already gathering.

Too late.

## Sera and Tomren Move

Sera's shoulders rolled once—a fighter's reflex—before she exploded from the shadows like a vengeful spirit. Her blade caught the burning cultist across the throat—a clean strike, precise, lethal. He dropped without a sound.

Tomren's crossbow *thunked*. The bolt took the fallen cultist through the chest, ensuring he wouldn't rise again.

"Both targets eliminated," Tomren called out, already reloading. "Area secure for now."

---

## The Hollow Shape

The entity-shadow twisted toward him with impossible geometry, its hollow form rippling with wrongness that hurt to perceive. It didn't burn—fire passed *through* it like light through water, finding nothing solid to consume, the flames distorting around its edges. It opened what might be a mouth, a tear in reality itself, and a sound emerged—not heard but *felt*, vibrating through bone and brain, a frequency that made his teeth ache and his skull throb and his thoughts scatter like leaves in wind. The sensation was *wrong*, invasive, like cold fingers reaching inside his mind and pulling things apart.

*It was trying to unmake his concentration. To unmake* him.

*Theron held. Barely.*

His vision blurred at the edges, colors bleeding together, walls seeming to breathe and flex, reality trying to fray like old fabric. But he *anchored* himself with desperate force. His hand found his component pouch, fingers pressing against the familiar leather hard enough to bruise. The spellbook against his chest, solid and real and his. Whisper's claws in his shoulder, tiny pinpoints of grounding pain. The heat of flames on his face, real and burning and alive.

*He was real. He was there. He would not be erased. He would not.*

---

Theron pivoted toward the herald fragment, the words of *Dispel Magic* already forming—but no. That wasn't enough. This thing wasn't a spell to be dispelled. It was an *intrusion*.

Theron needed **Banishment**.

His thumb traced across his fingertips, each touch marking a syllable, grounding the complex weaving. The incantation rose, his voice cutting through the roar of flames and the witch's screaming fury. His hand traced the sigil in the air—a doorway, but reversed. Not summoning. *Expelling*.

"By the boundaries between worlds, by the laws that separate what is from what should not be—"


---

*The herald fragment SHRIEKS.*

Not sound—*anti-sound*. A void where noise should be, silence so complete and wrong it felt like pressure inside his skull, like his ears were bleeding though they weren't. It thrashed, its hollow form collapsing inward like a dying star, edges fraying and burning like paper caught in invisible flame.

A rift opened behind it—not to another plane, but to *nowhere*. The space between spaces, a tear in the fabric of everything. Cold poured through, not temperature but the *absence* of warmth, of light, of hope. The herald was *pulled*, stretched like taffy, its shadowy form elongating and distorting as reality reasserted itself, forcing it out like an infection expelled.

For one heartbeat—eternal and instant—he saw something *beyond* it. A vastness that made the ocean look like a puddle, that made mountains look like grains of sand. An eye that wasn't an eye, a presence that was awareness without form, ancient beyond comprehension. The weight of Szeth-Kaan's attention pressed against the membrane of the world, and Theron felt it looking *at* him, *through* him, *into* him.

*It saw him.* Knew him. Tasted his soul.

*It would remember.*

Then the rift snapped shut with a sound like reality healing itself, and the herald was *gone*, and Theron was gasping, shaking, blood dripping from his nose though he didn't remember it starting.

---

## The Witch Alone

"*NO!*"

The witch's scream was raw. Desperate. For a moment, the ancient mask slipped and Theron saw something almost *human*—centuries of work, of bargains, of sacrifices, torn away in seconds.

"Two hundred years," she gasped, staring at the space where the herald vanished. "Two hundred years I cultivated that connection. Feeding it. Binding it. Promising it..." Her eyes snapped to him, and the humanity vanished, replaced by something colder than winter. "You dare. You *dare* undo my work?"

The flames were dying now, smothered by her will, but the damage was done. Her study was ruined. Her cultists were dead. Her connection to Szeth-Kaan had been *severed*—at least temporarily.

She stood alone in the wreckage, white hair singed, black eyes blazing with millennia of accumulated hatred.

"You," she said, voice singular now—no longer layered with the herald's whispers, no longer fractured by ancient power. Just *her*. Morganna. The girl who once held wildflowers, now holding only rage. "The prisoner who escaped. The thief who stole my familiar."

Her gaze found Whisper on his shoulder, and something ancient and wounded flickered across her face.

"Traitor," she hissed. "Forty years of service, and you betray me for *this*?" She gestured dismissively at Theron. "For another desperate fool chasing ghosts?"

"Survivor," Whisper corrected softly. "And he's no fool. He's—"

"I know what he is." Her eyes narrowed, studying Theron's face with sudden intensity. "I know that *look*. The grief. The determination." A cold smile. "Tell me, wizard—what did you lose? A lover? A child? They all come here seeking something. And they all end the same way."

Theron's jaw tightened. She didn't remember. Lucian was just one victim among dozens, maybe hundreds. A footnote in her journal. Disposable.

"Let me clarify," he said, voice cold and precise. "My name is Theron Ashborne."

Something flickered in her expression. Recognition? No—just calculation. Weighing whether the name meant anything, whether she should *remember*.

"Ashborne." She tasted the name, then dismissed it. "Means nothing. You're all the same in the end. Ambitious. Arrogant. Thinking you can challenge *me*." She raised her hands, dark energy crackling between her fingers. "I've killed paladins. Witch hunters. Master wizards with twice your experience. What makes you think you're *special*?"

"Let me think... special? No." Theron's voice carried academic precision, each word carefully chosen. "But I am willing to die here if it means no one else has to. No more sons. No more daughters. No more families like mine, like Sera's, like all the others you've destroyed." He met her eyes. "You sacrifice others to preserve yourself. I'll sacrifice myself to stop you. That's the difference between us."

The witch laughed—a sound like breaking glass. But there was something uncertain in it now. "Noble. Stupid. They always *say* that. But when death comes, they all beg—"

"Then you'll see," Theron said, his academic tone unwavering even in the face of death. "When that moment comes for me."

She was weakened—he could see it, feel it—but she was far from helpless. Centuries of power didn't evaporate because he burned her library and banished her patron.

But she was alone now. No cultists. No herald. No Szeth-Kaan whispering in her ear.

Just a witch, a wizard, and a reckoning.

---

**Combat Status:**

- **Cultists:** DEAD
- **Herald Fragment:** BANISHED (Szeth-Kaan's connection temporarily severed)
- **The Witch:** Wounded, weakened, *furious*
- **Your Party:** Unharmed (so far)

**Sera** readied her blade, circling left. Her fingers brushed the locket at her throat—once, quick—before she adjusted her sword grip.

**Tomren** positioned himself at Sera's back, crossbow aimed at the witch's heart. Click-click-click—adjusting the tension, preparing.

**Whisper** hissed from his shoulder: "End it now. Before she recovers. Before she summons something worse."

---

*Theron read the rhythm of her casting like sheet music—the gathering darkness, the hungry void forming between her fingers. He knew this spell. He'd seen it in forbidden texts, warned students against it.*

*Soul Siphon. If it hit, it didn't just kill. It* consumed.

His lips moved, muttering counter-incantation fragments under his breath, preparing.

"This is how it ends for all of you," the witch said, almost conversationally, as the darkness coalesced in her palm. "Fighting. Struggling. Thinking you matter. But you're just *fuel*. Just another—"

"Let me think... no." Theron's voice was steady, analytical even now. "Your casting pattern—I recognize it from the forbidden texts. Soul Siphon, if I'm correct. Not today, witch."

---

Theron snapped his hand up, the counter-incantation spilling from his lips like water dousing flame. His magic crashed into hers at the moment of release—

---

*The Soul Siphon inverted.*

"No—" Her eyes widened, pupils dilating in sudden fear. "*No*—you can't—"

But he could. And he did.

The witch's own magic reversed course like a snake turning on its master, like a river flowing backward. The hungry void snapped back toward its creator with terrible inevitability, dark tendrils wrapping around her arms, her chest, her *throat*, tightening like living rope. She clawed at them, fingers passing through shadow, finding nothing to grip.

She screamed. Not rage this time. Not fury or indignation. *Pain*. Real, genuine, mortal pain—raw and visceral, the sound torn from a throat that hadn't made such sounds in centuries. The sound of someone discovering they could *hurt* again, that they could *bleed*, that they were not invincible after all.

"*Impossible*—I perfected this—spent *decades*—" The words came in gasps, breath hitching, voice cracking. "No one has ever—"

The spell wasn't designed to be survivable from the inside. It tore at her essence like hooks in flesh, feeding on the very power she poured into it, consuming her from within. Black veins spidered across her pale skin, spreading from her heart outward like cracks in porcelain, the ritualistic patterns glowing sickly green and pulsing with each labored heartbeat. Her knees buckled, joints failing, and she made a sound—half-gasp, half-sob—that might have been mortal once.

"You're... you're just a *child*," she gasped, disbelief warring with agony. "A hedge wizard. I've walked this earth for *three hundred years*—"

She dropped.

For the first time in centuries, Morganna the Witch of Thornhollow was on her knees before someone.
---

Tomren took one deep breath, went perfectly still, then loosed. The bolt streaked toward the witch but she twisted, weakened but not helpless, and it grazed her shoulder instead of her heart.

Theron didn't hesitate. Silver mist erupted around him, cool and ethereal against his burned skin, reality folding like paper, space bending and *stepping*—

—emerging three feet from her crumpled form, boots solidifying on stone, close enough to see the black tears leaking from her starfire eyes, thick and viscous like oil. Close enough to smell centuries of dark magic rotting from within—ozone and old blood and something sweeter underneath, like fruit left too long to ferment, like decay wrapped in perfume. The smell made his stomach turn.

She looked up at him, pale face twisted. Hatred blazing in those wrong eyes. Fear—real fear, perhaps for the first time in centuries. Something that might almost be *respect*.

"Clever... little... mage..." A bloody smile, black ichor coating her teeth. "You remind me of someone. That boy—eight years ago? Dark hair, clever eyes. He had your same..." She coughed, black blood spraying from her lips, spattering the stone between them. "...your same determination. Before I—"

"Let me clarify precisely." Theron's voice was ice-cold, his precision sharpening under the weight of emotion. "His name was Lucian Ashborne. My *son*."

Her expression shifted. Recognition. Then—was that *remorse*? No. Just calculation. Always calculation.

"Ah." She almost laughed. "Then this is... poetic. The father avenging the—" She tried to rise, power flickering around her fingers. "But you're too *late*, wizard. Eight years too late. And you'll never—"

Her hand twitched, reaching for another spell—

---

"No. You will not."

The words carried weight. Power. *Command*. Academic precision honed to a cutting edge, every syllable deliberate.

His hand touched his spellbook beneath his robe—one brief moment of certainty, of connection—before he spoke the incantation, each word resonating with absolute authority. His will slammed into hers like a hammer against cracked glass, shattering her defenses, forcing itself into her nervous system, seizing control.

---

*She froze.*

Every muscle locked instantly, tendons going rigid, breath catching mid-inhale. Her reaching hand stopped mid-gesture, fingers curled like claws, knuckles white, nails biting into her own palm. Her mouth hung open, mid-incantation, jaw slack, the words dying unspoken on her tongue. Only her eyes moved—darting frantically left to right, up and down, pupils contracting and dilating, furious, desperate, *terrified*.

She was paralyzed. Completely. Helplessly. Unable to move, unable to speak, unable to cast.

*At his mercy.*

And in her eyes, for just a moment, Theron saw something he didn't expect: understanding. She knew what came next. She'd been on this side of the exchange dozens of times. Hundreds. Had stood over paralyzed victims, had seen this exact terror reflected in their eyes before she ended them.

But never on *this* side. Never helpless. Never the prey.
