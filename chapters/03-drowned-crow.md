# Chapter 3: The Drowned Crow

## Intelligence Gathering

Theron mopped up the last of the egg yolk with his bread, then rose casually and returned to the bar. The tavern smelled of woodsmoke, bacon grease, and stale ale—familiar, almost comforting after days in the witch's dungeon. The barkeep was drying tankards with a rag, the fabric making soft squeaking sounds against the pewter.

He leaned against the counter, feeling the warmth from the kitchen fire on his left side, keeping his voice low beneath the murmur of morning conversations around him.

"I have a question, if you don't mind. Those two in the corner—are they regulars here?"

She glanced past him, then back. Her expression didn't change, but something flickered behind her eyes—caution, maybe respect for his discretion.

"Regulars enough. They've been through Millhaven three, four times this season." She set down a tankard. "Hunters. The dangerous kind. Not bandits or beasts—they hunt *worse* things."

"What's your assessment of their competence?"

A dry laugh. "They're still alive, aren't they? The woman's called **Sera Vex**. Used to be a soldier—officer, I heard, before something went sour. The big fellow's **Tomren**. Doesn't talk much. Doesn't need to, with that crossbow of his."

She leaned closer, voice dropping.

"Word is they've been poking around Thornhollow for weeks. Asking questions. Mapping the forest." Her eyes narrowed. "You're the second person this month to stumble in here looking like they crawled out of a grave. The last one..."

She trailed off.

"The last one what?"

"Didn't make it through the night. Fever took him. Kept mumbling about a witch and something she'd *summoned*."

Whisper shifted beneath his collar.

*The barkeep studied him with newfound interest.*

"You've got that same look, stranger. But you're still standing." She nodded toward the corner. "If you know something about what's up in those woods—those two are your best bet. Just..."

She hesitated.

"Don't waste their time. Sera doesn't suffer fools."

## First Contact

Theron approached the table with unhurried steps, hands visible, posture open—no threat here, just a traveler. His still-damp robes clung uncomfortably to his shoulders. Sera's eyes tracked him the moment he left the bar, sharp and assessing. Tomren's hand drifted toward the crossbow, then stopped. Waiting. The fire crackled behind them, casting shifting shadows across their faces.

"Apologies for the interruption," Theron said, voice calm. "I overheard you mention Thornhollow. May I ask—are you planning an expedition there?"

Sera's scarred face remained unreadable. "Lots of people mention Thornhollow. It's the local nightmare. Doesn't mean we're holding auditions."

"I'm not seeking employment. I'm offering intelligence in exchange for mutual benefit."

A flicker of interest. Tomren glanced at Sera.

Theron continued, measured. His left thumb rubbed across his fingertips in sequence—index to pinky, a habit from years of component work. Thinking. Calculating the approach. "I was in those woods recently. Saw things. The kind of information that might be useful to people planning an assault."

Sera leaned back, arms crossed. "And what makes you think we're planning anything?"

He paused, choosing his words. "You've been scouting for weeks. That's not bounty-hunting methodology. That's tactical preparation for a sustained operation."

*Silence. The fire crackled, and somewhere in the kitchen, pots clanged against stone. Outside, a cart rattled past on the muddy street.*

Sera's hand moved unconsciously to the silver chain at her throat, thumb tracing the outline of the locket hidden beneath. A split-second tell—stress, decision-making. Tomren's fingers found his crossbow, making the smallest adjustment to the tension mechanism. *Click-click.* The sound barely audible above the tavern's ambient noise. Thinking.

They exchanged a look. Some unspoken communication passed between them, years of partnership in a single glance.

"Sit," she said finally, her hand dropping from the locket. "Hands visible."

Theron sat, placing his hands flat on the rough wooden table. The surface was scarred and sticky with spilled ale. His fingers twitched toward his component pouch—empty, stolen—before he caught himself. The absence still felt wrong, like a missing tooth his tongue kept probing.

"I'm Theron. The rat on my shoulder is Whisper."

Sera's eyes flicked to the familiar, then back. "Wizard?"

"Was. Currently between spellbooks."

That got a reaction—a slight raise of her eyebrow. A wizard without a spellbook was like a soldier without a sword.

Sera Vex. Tomren." She leaned forward. "What did you see in Thornhollow? Specific numbers."

Theron chose his words carefully. His thumb moved again—index, middle, ring, pinky. Thinking. "Let me think... Thralls. At least a dozen. Cultists—organized, armed. And something else. Something she's summoned. I didn't get a good look, but..." He met her eyes. "It's worse than the stories say."

Sera's jaw tightened, her hand finding the locket again. Tomren's crossbow clicked softly as he adjusted the tension. Both processing the threat assessment.

"You were inside?" Sera asked, voice sharp. "Inside the castle?"

"I was detained. Held against my will for—" He paused, calculating. "Approximately seventy-two hours. I effected my escape through the eastern drainage system."

"How many guards?"

"Three patrols in that sector. I avoided direct confrontation."

Sera studied him for a long moment. Her eyes tracked his posture, his hands, the way he held himself. Soldier's assessment—counting exits, measuring threats, evaluating assets. *Assess. Adapt. Act.* Looking for lies, for madness, for anything that would mark him as useless or dangerous.

*He let her look.*

Finally, she leaned back. "We should talk. Not here. Too many ears." She glanced toward the window, where villagers passed by outside. Already counting how many ears, how many potential problems. "Storage barn. East side. Eighteen hundred hours."

"May I ask why the delay?"

"I need to verify you are who you say you are. And you decide if you trust us." Her eyes were cold. "Take the day. Show up at dusk, we talk terms."

Theron nodded slowly. Fair enough. She was careful. That was good—it meant she might actually survive what they were planning.

He rose from the table.

"Dusk, then."

## The Long Afternoon

Theron spent the rest of the day in Millhaven, keeping a low profile. He bought a few supplies with his remaining coin—dried meat, a waterskin, a small knife. Nothing that would draw attention.

Whisper scouted, reporting back periodically.

"Sera visited the village elder. Asked about recent disappearances. The numbers are... concerning." The rat's whiskers twitched. "Three villagers in the last month. All young. All vanished without a trace."

"The witch is accelerating," Theron murmured.

"Or preparing something big."

That thought sat heavy in his gut. If she was gathering power for a ritual—if she had his spellbook, his component pouch, and fresh victims—

*What is she planning?*

And somewhere, buried in the back of his mind: *Did Lucian make it here? Did he see this castle before—*

He pushed the thought away. He'd find out. Once he was inside again, once he could search properly—

"Theron," Whisper's voice cut through his spiraling thoughts. "Two riders approaching. From the north."

He turned, casually glancing toward the road.

Two figures on horseback, wearing dark robes marked with symbols he recognized.

*The witch's cultists.*

His blood went cold.

## Unwelcome Visitors

The cultists rode into the village square with the easy confidence of armed travelers, hoofbeats thudding on the packed dirt. Their horses were lathered with sweat, smelling of exertion and fear. The villagers stopped what they were doing, eyes following the strangers with a mixture of curiosity and caution. A woman pulled her child closer. A blacksmith's hammer went silent mid-strike.

*Armed riders. Dark robes. Symbols on their cloaks—old symbols, the kind that made people uneasy.* The horses stamped and snorted, leather creaking as the riders shifted in their saddles.

Most villagers returned to their business after a moment, keeping a wary distance. Just travelers, probably. Dangerous ones, maybe mercenaries or pilgrims from the old castle ruins up north. Nothing to do with them.

But inside the tavern, the barkeep's face went pale. She knew those symbols.

One cultist dismounted—a tall woman with a shaved head and a brand on her cheek. The other remained mounted, hand on his sword hilt.

The village elder approached slowly, uncertain but trying to maintain his authority.

"Travelers?" he asked carefully. "The inn has rooms, if you need lodging—"

"We're not here for lodging," the woman said, voice carrying across the square. "We're looking for someone. A stranger. Arrived this morning, probably soaked and exhausted."

Theron's heart hammered, pulse loud in his ears. Sweat prickled cold down his spine despite the afternoon warmth. *They know.*

His hand moved instinctively to his component pouch—still empty, still stolen. The absence felt like missing a limb. He was standing near the blacksmith's shop, the smell of hot iron and coal smoke thick in the air. Partially hidden by a stack of barrels, he could feel splinters catching on his damp robes. Slowly, carefully, he began backing into the shadows, each step measured to avoid sound.

"A stranger?" the elder stammered. "We get travelers sometimes, but—"

"A wizard," the cultist clarified. "Escaped from the Lady's hospitality. She's... displeased." A cold smile. "Anyone who provides information will be rewarded. Anyone who hides him will burn."

The square had gone silent. Villagers exchanged fearful glances.

The cultist's eyes swept the crowd—

And landed on the tavern.

"Search there first," she ordered her companion. "Check every room. If you find him, take him alive. The Lady has questions."

Whisper's claws dug into Theron's shoulder. "Run. Now."

But before he could move, the tavern door burst open.

Sera Vex stepped out, crossbow in hand.

No wizard here. And you're not welcome.

The cultists turned. The woman's hand went to her sword.

"Sera Vex," she said, recognition dawning. "Still searching for your lost daughter? The Lady wondered when you'd gather the courage to knock on her door."

Sera's expression didn't change, but Theron saw her knuckles whiten on the crossbow. Her free hand moved fractionally toward the locket at her throat—then stopped, forced back down. Control. Discipline.

Leave. Before I decide you're worth the bolt.

The cultist laughed. "You're outnumbered, soldier. There are more of us in the woods. One shout and—"

Tomren appeared in the tavern doorway behind Sera, his own crossbow raised. The faint *click-click* of the tension mechanism being adjusted—habit, precision, readiness.

"Make that two crossbows."

The cultists hesitated.

And in that moment, the mounted one's eyes flicked across the square—

And locked onto Theron.

"There!" he shouted, pointing. "The wizard!"

*Damn.*

## The Fight

Everything happened at once.

The female cultist drew her sword, steel rasping against the scabbard. Sera fired—the crossbow's *twang* sharp in the tense air. The bolt took the mounted cultist in the shoulder with a wet *thunk*, spinning him from his horse. He hit the ground hard, the impact raising dust. His horse bolted, hooves clattering on stone. Tomren was already reloading, the mechanical *click-click-click* of the mechanism fast and practiced.

The remaining cultist charged Sera with a roar, boots pounding the earth.

Theron stepped out from the shadows, raising his hand. His palm burned as he pulled power from nothing. No spellbook. No components. Just will and words and the dregs of his power.

"*Flamma!*"

Fire burst from his palm—not a full *Firebolt*, but enough. The heat scorched his own skin. The flames caught the charging cultist across the face with a whoosh of igniting cloth, and she screamed, stumbling. The smell of burnt hair and flesh hit him, acrid and sickening.

Sera didn't waste the opening. She dropped the crossbow with a clatter, drew a short sword, and closed the distance in three steps. Steel met steel with a sharp *clang* that rang across the square. Sparks flew from the impact.

The wounded cultist was struggling to his feet, blood streaming from his shoulder and dripping into the dust. The copper smell of blood mixed with horse sweat. Tomren's second bolt took him in the leg with another meaty *thunk*, and he went down with a cry of pain and rage.

Theron circled wide, hands ready to cast again if needed. His power was nearly spent, but he could manage one more cantrip if Sera needed help.

Sera and the female cultist traded blows—fast, brutal, efficient. Steel rang against steel, each impact jarring up through Sera's arm. Their boots scraped and slid on the packed earth, kicking up dust. The cultist was good, breathing hard through gritted teeth, but Sera was *better*. A feint, a parry, muscles burning with exertion, and then Sera's blade found flesh—sliding between ribs with a sound like cutting through leather. The cultist gasped, stumbling back, hand pressed to her side. Blood welled between her fingers, hot and dark.

"Yield. Now," Sera commanded, her own breath coming hard, sweat dripping down her temple despite the cool air.

The cultist spat blood, the spray hitting the dirt. "The Lady will—"

Sera's pommel struck her temple with a dull crack. The cultist collapsed, limbs going slack.

Silence fell over the square. In the sudden stillness, Theron could hear his own ragged breathing, smell the blood and burnt flesh, feel his legs trembling with adrenaline's aftermath.

Villagers stared, wide-eyed. Some terrified. Some... hopeful?

Sera looked at Theron, then at the two unconscious cultists.

Well. Guess we're having that conversation now."

---

## Flight

"Need to move. More cultists in the woods." Tomren was already binding the cultists' hands.

"They'll come looking." Sera turned to the elder. "Get these people inside. Bar the doors. More cultists come, tell them we went south toward Dunmere."

"But—"

"*Do it.*"

The elder nodded shakily.

Sera grabbed her pack from inside the tavern, Tomren right behind her. She looked at Theron.

You're coming with us. No arguments. That fight made you our asset."

"I didn't ask—"

"Don't care. You know Thornhollow's interior. Strategic value." Her eyes were hard. "Witch knows you're here. We're all on borrowed time." She started toward the village edge. "Move now. Plan at rally point."

Theron glanced at Whisper. The rat's expression was unreadable.

"She's right," the familiar murmured. "And honestly? We could do worse for allies."

*Could we do better?*

No time to wonder.

Theron followed Sera and Tomren into the forest.

## Into the Woods

They moved fast, putting distance between themselves and Millhaven. Branches whipped at Theron's face, leaving stinging scratches. His lungs burned, legs aching from the pace. Sera led with the confidence of someone who'd scouted these woods a hundred times, never breaking stride over roots or through undergrowth. Behind them, Tomren brought up the rear, crossbow ready, his breathing barely labored despite the pace. Eyes scanning for pursuit.

Theron kept pace, sweat soaking through his already-damp robes, his borrowed sword bouncing awkwardly at his hip with every stride. The forest smelled of pine and damp earth, cooler in the shade of the canopy.

After an hour, Sera called a halt near a small stream. The sound of running water was immediately soothing after the pounding of their boots on forest floor. They were deep in the forest now, surrounded by old growth and shadow. Birds called overhead—returning after the disturbance of their passage. The temperature had dropped; Theron's sweat-soaked clothes made him shiver.

Here." Sera pointed to a dense thicket. "Two hours rest. Move at twenty-one hundred."

She pulled out her map, spreading it on a flat stone still damp with moss. The paper crinkled softly. Tomren took up a watch position against a broad oak, facing back the way they'd come, his crossbow resting across his knees.

Theron sat heavily on the forest floor, breathing hard, each breath tasting of pine resin and his own exhaustion. His muscles ached—thighs burning, calves cramping. His damp robes chafed at neck and underarms, the fabric scratching against skin with every movement. His hands trembled slightly, adrenaline still working through his system. But he was alive. The forest floor was surprisingly soft beneath him—layers of moss and old leaves, slightly damp but better than stone.

Sera studied him across the map.

"Assessment time. Why does the witch deploy active pursuit for one escaped prisoner?"

Theron met her eyes. This was the moment. Trust or suspicion. Alliance or alone.

He thought of Lucian. Of the journal entry he'd someday find. Of the truth he needed.

"Let me think." He paused. "I don't know. I was detained like any other prisoner. But..." He hesitated. "I came to Thornhollow searching for someone. My son. He disappeared eight years ago—precisely eight years, two months—chasing rumors of a witch who could teach him magic."

Sera's expression softened—just slightly. Understanding.

"You think he found her," she said quietly.

"I think he might have. And if he did..." Theron's voice roughened, becoming more precise despite the emotion. "I need to establish what happened. Find him, or—" He stopped. "Or at least confirm his status. One way or another."

Sera was silent for a moment. Then she reached up and pulled the silver locket from beneath her cloak.

Elina. My daughter. Sixteen. Taken six months ago." She opened the locket, showing a small painted portrait—a young woman with dark eyes and Sera's sharp features. "Witch has her. Don't know why. Don't know if she's alive. Going to find out."

Their eyes met across the map.

Two parents. Two missing children. Two impossible rescues.

Tomren's gruff voice broke the silence.

"I owe Sera twice over. She asked for help, and I didn't hesitate." He didn't turn from his watch. "Your son. Her daughter. We're going in regardless."

Sera extended her hand across the map.

Provisional alliance. Joint operation. Mutual objectives." Her scarred face was serious. "Mission priority: intelligence, extraction, survival. Betray us, threat neutralization is immediate."

Theron looked at her hand. At Tomren's solid presence. At the map marking paths to Thornhollow.

He clasped her hand.

"Agreed."

Whisper sighed from his shoulder.

"Well. This is either brilliantly strategic or phenomenally stupid." The rat's whiskers twitched. "Knowing you lot, probably both."

---

*They rested until dusk, then moved deeper into the forest, away from Millhaven, away from pursuit.*

*Behind them, in the village square, the two bound cultists were beginning to wake.*

*And in Thornhollow castle, the witch raised her head, sensing disturbance in the threads of her web.*

*The wizard lived. And now he'd found allies.*

*How... interesting.*
