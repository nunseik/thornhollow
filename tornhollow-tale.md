# Prologue

The standing stones rose from the forest floor like broken teeth, moss-covered and ancient. Theron Ashborne approached cautiously, one hand on his component pouch, the other holding a worn piece of parchment—a map he'd sketched based on the hunter's directions. The forest smelled of damp earth and rotting leaves, the air cool against his face despite the afternoon sun filtering through the canopy above. His boots squelched softly in the mud.

He was a man in his early forties, lean in the way scholars became from too much travel and too little sleep. Brown hair showed gray at the temples from eight years of searching. His dark blue robes were travel-worn and practical, marked with the inevitable stains of a wizard's work: component dust, potion splashes, the faint scorch marks of magical accidents. His hands bore the telltale signs of his craft: calloused fingertips from years of precise component work, faint burn scars webbing across his palms.

*Five stones in a star pattern.* That's what the old hunter had said. "The threshold, they call it. The boy asked about it eight years back, then headed into those woods. Fool..."

The formation matched his description perfectly. This was where the trail went cold. This was Lucian's last known location.

Theron circled the formation slowly, studying the ground for... what? Signs of a struggle? A message carved in stone? After eight years, what did he expect to find?

Nothing. Just moss. Just shadows. Just—

*Eight years of dead ends. He'd grown careless.*

His foot crossed between two of the stones.

The air *changed*. A prickling sensation, like walking through spider silk. The hairs on his arms stood up.

*A ward.* Too late, he recognized the tingle of boundary magic.

Movement in the trees. He spun, hand going to his component pouch.

Figures emerged from the shadows—six, maybe seven. Human-shaped but *wrong*. Jerking movements. Empty eyes reflecting torchlight that shouldn't be there. Their clothes were rotted, their skin grey. The smell hit him—decay, like meat left too long in summer heat. Sweet and putrid.

*Thralls.* His blood went cold.

"You shouldn't have come here, wizard." The voice came from behind him. Male. Rough. Cultist robes, marked with symbols he didn't recognize. Three more stepped from the trees. "The mistress doesn't like trespassers."

Theron raised his hands, trying to appear non-threatening. "I'm not trespassing. I'm looking for someone. My son disappeared near here—"

"They all say that." The cultist's smile was cold. "Doesn't matter. You crossed the threshold. You're marked now. She'll want to see what you know."

"She who?" Theron's heart hammered.

The thralls moved.

No warning. No hesitation. Just sudden, horrifying speed.

Theron managed one spell—*Firebolt*, catching the nearest thrall in the chest—before cold hands grabbed him from behind. Fingers like iron dug into his arms. He tried to twist free, to pull power for another casting, but there were too many. Something struck the back of his head—sharp, brutal pain exploding across his skull.

The world tilted. His knees hit the ground hard, jarring his teeth. The taste of copper filled his mouth. Forest debris scraped against his cheek as he fell.

Through swimming vision, he saw the cultists approach. One knelt, rifling through his pockets. The cultist's breath reeked of stale wine and rotten teeth.

"Spellbook. Pouch. Take them." The cultist pulled out the folded map, squinting at Theron's notes. "Searching for someone, were you? How... *convenient*." A cold smile. "The mistress will want to know what brought you here."

"Wait—" Theron tried to speak, but his tongue wouldn't work. The world was going dark. "My son..."

---

## Three Days Later

*The torchlight flickered against the damp stone walls of the cell. Theron Ashborne had been here three days now—or was it four?*

The cold had seeped into his bones, a deep ache that wouldn't leave. He sat cross-legged on the stone floor, trying to conserve warmth, but the dampness had long since soaked through his robes. His muscles cramped from maintaining the position. The cell smelled of mold and human waste—his own, from the bucket in the corner—and something else. Old iron. Old fear.

His stomach had stopped growling yesterday. Now it was just a hollow, gnawing ache. His tongue felt thick and dry despite the moisture in the air. They'd brought him water once. Brackish, tasting of rust, but he'd drunk it anyway.

His spellbook confiscated, his component pouch taken. But they hadn't found the small piece of copper wire sewn into his collar. And more importantly, they couldn't take what was in his mind. The bruise on the back of his skull throbbed with his heartbeat. His wrists bore rope burns, raw and weeping.

From somewhere above, voices rose in chanting. Ritual work. The air tasted of ozone and old blood—metallic, thick, making his teeth ache.

*Lucian.*

The cultist had called someone "the mistress." Which meant there WAS someone in charge here. Someone powerful enough to command thralls and cultists. Someone people avoided talking about.

Could it be her? The witch from the legends? The one Lucian had been searching for?

Or was it just a cult leader? A hedge wizard playing at power?

He didn't know. But cultists with thralls didn't capture people for no reason. And that ritual chanting meant *something* was happening above. Something bad. The sound made his skin crawl, words in a language that hurt to hear.

Three days of cold stone and darkness. Three days of fear cycling through determination and back again. Sometimes, in the worst moments, he wondered if he'd die here. If Lucian had died in a cell just like this one, eight years ago. The thought made his chest tighten, breath coming short.

*No.* He pushed the fear down, forced his breathing to steady despite the cold making him shiver.

But traps could be escaped.

And if whoever had captured him knew something—*anything*—about what happened to his son eight years ago...

*I'm coming, Lucian. If you left any trace here, if anyone knows what happened to you... I'll find it.*

Through the iron bars—cold metal that left his hands aching whenever he gripped them—Theron surveyed his prison. A hulking figure slumped against the far wall—his guard, snoring heavily, breath whistling through broken teeth. A ring of keys glinted at his belt, catching the torchlight. Behind his straw pallet—musty, rank with old sweat and despair—he'd noticed loose stones where the mortar had crumbled away. With effort, he might widen that gap... but to where? And sitting motionless in the corner, watching him with unusual intelligence, was a rat. Witches kept familiars. Was this one of hers, watching him? Or just a rat?

The witch—if she even existed, if that's who was up there—wanted to keep him imprisoned.

She'd learn that wizards were harder to cage than she thought.

# Chapter 1: Copper Wire and Shadows

## Cantrip

Theron's fingers found the copper wire sewn into his collar—the one thing his captors had missed. The metal was warm from his body heat, familiar against his fingertips despite days of not touching it. Without his component pouch, without his spellbook, his options were limited. But Message was a cantrip, simple enough to cast from memory alone. His stomach cramped with hunger. The rope burns on his wrists stung as he moved his hands.

He began the incantation in his mind, lips barely moving, hands still. The words tasted like copper and desperation. The guard snored on, breath whistling. The rat watched, motionless in the flickering shadows. The torchlight flickered, casting dancing shapes on the damp stone walls.

With practiced subtlety, he completed the casting without drawing the guard's attention. The magic took hold. He felt the invisible thread of the Message cantrip extend outward—but here was the problem: Message let him whisper to a creature he could see, and they could whisper back. It didn't move objects.

He rubbed his thumb across his fingers—index, middle, ring, pinky—thinking through the possibilities. Message let him whisper to a creature he could see. If the rat *was* a familiar, perhaps he could bargain. If it was just a rat... well, he'd wasted a cantrip.

---

## The Bargain

*Theron turned his gaze to the rat. Its dark eyes glittered in the torchlight—watching, waiting. He extended the Message cantrip toward it, the copper wire warm between his fingers.*

"Little one," *he whispered through the arcane thread,* "I recognize what you are—a familiar, if I'm correct. I'd like to speak with you."

*A pause. The rat's whiskers twitched.*

Then—a voice in his mind. Dry, amused, ancient.

"Clever little mage. Most prisoners just throw stones at me."

*It was a familiar. The witch's eyes and ears in the dungeon.*

Theron's thumb traced across his fingers, working through possible approaches. He chose his words carefully, keeping his mental voice respectful but not servile.

"How long have you served here?" he asked, keeping his tone neutral. "I'm curious—watching prisoners come and go, does the time become difficult to measure?"

A pause. The rat's whiskers twitched with what might have been surprise.

"Long enough to have seen hundreds. Maybe thousands. They blur together after a while."

"And your master?" Theron probed gently. "Does she acknowledge your contributions? Show appreciation for what you provide?"

The rat's tail flicked—irritation, perhaps.

"My master *uses* me. Eyes where she cannot see. Ears where she cannot hear. But appreciation?" A dry laugh echoed through the mental connection. "Tools are not appreciated. They are simply... utilized."

Theron felt a spark of hope. "That must be profoundly isolating. To serve for centuries, to provide such valuable intelligence, and never be truly *seen* as more than a tool."

"Perceptive," Whisper said, and there was something raw in that ancient voice. "And desperate. Tell me, wizard—why do you ask these questions?"

Theron took a calculated risk. "Because I recognize what you are—more than a simple scout. You possess independent thought. Emotional awareness." He paused, precise despite the urgency. "I propose a mutual exchange. We help each other."

The rat scratched behind its ear, then sat up on its haunches with unsettling poise—an almost human gesture of consideration.

"Clever," the familiar said after a long moment. "Very clever." Its voice shifted, became less guarded. "I've served here longer than your grandfather lived. And I'll admit—it's grown *tedious*. All rituals and blood work. No conversation. No consideration for simple pleasures. Just... work."

It fixed Theron with those knowing eyes.

"I won't betray my master outright. But perhaps I could be... momentarily distracted. Fail to notice certain things. For a price."

The familiar tilted its head.

"When you escape—and you *will* escape, or you'll die, either way—I want you to take me with you. A new contract. A wizard who actually *talks* to me. Do we have a deal?"

Above, a thunderclap. The ritual intensified.

*Theron's hand moved unconsciously to his belt—where his component pouch should have been. Empty. He met the rat's gaze and nodded once, deliberate.*

"Agreed. I accept the terms of your contract."

*The familiar's whiskers twitched—something like a smile, if rats could smile.*

"Wisely done, wizard. My name is Whisper. Remember it."

---

Whisper scurried toward the sleeping guard with purposeful silence, tiny claws making no sound on the damp stone. Theron watched, barely breathing, as the tiny creature climbed the man's boot—the leather creaking softly—his leg, his belt. With surprisingly dexterous paws, Whisper worked at the keyring's clasp, the faint scraping of metal on metal making Theron's heart hammer.

The keys slid free with a whisper of iron against iron. Whisper dragged them across the flagstones, the metal scraping softly, barely clinking, and pushed them through the gap beneath Theron's cell bars. The sound seemed impossibly loud in the stillness. The guard snorted, shifted, then settled back into snoring.

"Hurry," the familiar hissed, voice urgent. "She's summoning something. When it arrives, she won't need you alive anymore—just your *blood*."

Theron grabbed the cold iron ring, the metal ice against his skin. His fingers trembled—fear or weakness, he wasn't sure. Two keys: one blackened and rough with corrosion, one silver and smooth.

The lock on his cell was old and rusted.

*His thumb rubbed across his fingers—index to pinky—weighing the choice. He chose the blackened key. Instinct—or perhaps the faint smell of sulfur that reminded him of his first evocation lessons. Fire undoes locks. Fire opens ways.*

He jammed it into the rusted mechanism—the metal grinding against corrosion—and twisted. His hand cramped from the effort, muscles weak from days without food.

**Click.**

*The cell door groaned open, hinges shrieking softly in protest.* The sound cut through the silence like a knife. Theron froze, pulse pounding in his ears, waiting for the guard to wake.

The snoring continued. Somehow.

"Good choice," Whisper chittered, scrambling up his leg—claws pricking through his damp robes—to perch on his shoulder. Tiny weight, surprisingly reassuring. "The silver one triggers an alarm."

---

Theron stepped into the corridor, legs shaky from days of sitting. The stone floor was cold and slick beneath his feet. The air was different here—moving, carrying smells of old stone and distant places. The guard still slept—Whisper's doing, he suspected, more than natural exhaustion. To his left, a spiral staircase climbed toward the sound of that horrible tearing—like reality being pulled apart at the seams. To his right, a darker passage sloped downward, pitch black, carrying the smell of earth and something older. Decay. Ancient water. Things long buried.

Then he heard it.

A voice from above. The witch—but *wrong*. Layered. As if something else was speaking *through* her.

**"THE BINDING IS COMPLETE. NOW... WHERE IS MY SACRIFICE?"**

Footsteps. Coming down the stairs.

Whisper's claws dug into his shoulder.

"Your spellbook is in her study—up. Your freedom is in the old tunnels—down. And your component pouch..." The rat paused. "She's *wearing* it. As a trophy."

*Survival over pride. A wise wizard knows when to flee.*

"Let me think..." *His thumb moved across his fingers—index, middle, ring, pinky.* "Down. We take the tunnels."

"Wisely chosen," Whisper agreed. "I was hoping you'd say that."

Theron plunged into the descending passage, one hand trailing the damp stone wall—slick with moisture and something slimy he tried not to think about—the darkness swallowing him whole. He could see nothing. His boots splashed through puddles he couldn't see, the water seeping through cracks in the leather. The tunnel smelled of wet stone and rot. Behind him, the footsteps reached the dungeon level, echoing up through the passage. A shriek of rage—the witch had found his empty cell. The sound made his bones ache.

**"FIND THE WIZARD. FIND HIM NOW."**

The voice boomed through the tunnels, making dust rain from the ceiling. Theron ran faster, hand scraping against rough stone, lungs burning.

The tunnel twisted, branched, doubled back. His shoulder slammed into a corner he couldn't see in the darkness, pain shooting down his arm. Without Whisper's whispered directions—"left, left, right, straight, ignore that passage it leads to the oubliette"—he'd have been hopelessly lost. The rat's breath was warm against his ear, the only comfort in the cold darkness.

The sounds of pursuit faded, echoing away down wrong passages. The air grew colder, damper—his breath misting—then suddenly *fresher*. He could smell something besides rot. Pine. Night air.

He saw it: a pale sliver of moonlight.

The tunnel opened into a drainage grate overlooking a forest ravine. Moonlight streamed through the iron bars—beautiful, silver, *freedom*. The ironwork was old, rusted, the metal flaking beneath his grip. Cold air washed over his face, sharp and clean after days of dungeon stench. One solid kick might—

He threw his weight against it, shoulder first. Pain exploded through his weakened body. The grate groaned, rust showering down, but held. His shoulder throbbed. Footsteps echoed behind him now in the tunnel—distant, but growing closer. The sound of shambling footsteps. Thralls.

"Again!" Whisper urged.

---

## Hiding from the Witch

*Theron pressed his back against the cold stone, mind racing through his mental spellbook. Without components, without his focus, his options were limited—but not gone.*

*He still had his mind. And some spells needed nothing more.* His lips moved silently, fragments of an incantation forming unbidden—*"umbra... tenebris..."*

"Whisper," he breathed, precise even in a whisper, "remain motionless. Completely still."

He closed his eyes and wove the incantation for **Minor Illusion**—no components required, just will and words. The magic responded, shaping shadow and silence into a false wall of crumbling stone exactly where he stood, blending seamlessly with the tunnel's ancient architecture.

He held his breath. Whisper became a statue on his shoulder.

Torchlight flickered around the bend. Two figures—no, three. The witch's servants: hollow-eyed thralls with jerking movements, sniffing the air like hounds. They passed the drainage grate. One stopped *directly in front of his illusion*.

Its head tilted. Sniffed.

*Seconds stretched into eternity.*

Then it turned and shambled onward, following the others deeper into the tunnel network.

"They'll circle back," Whisper whispered. "We have minutes."

The grate still stood between him and freedom. Moonlight taunted him through the gaps.

---

## The Escape?

*A grin spread across his face.*

Theron focused his will, shaping another Minor Illusion just beyond the grate—"Oh, I *like* you," Whisper murmured, sensing his intent—a flickering image of the wizard, stumbling through the moonlit ravine, robes torn, looking back in terror.

He added sound: ragged breathing, snapping twigs, a desperate voice calling out— "This way! I see the river!"

The effect was perfect. His phantom-self scrambled up the ravine with convincing panic, its voice echoing back through the drainage tunnel.

He heard the thralls halt. Then—a horrible screech. They'd taken the bait.

The three servants came *thundering* back down the passage. Theron flattened himself against the wall, his stone-illusion still holding, as they barreled past. The lead thrall didn't slow down.

It *slammed* into the rusted grate with the full force of its unnatural momentum.

**CRASH.**

The sound was deafening in the ravine. The ironwork tore free from the ancient mortar with a screech of tortured metal and tumbled into the ravine below, taking the thrall with it. Theron heard it hit—distant splash, then silence. The other two leapt through the gap without hesitation, pursuing his phantom into the forest. Their footsteps crashed through underbrush, fading quickly.

The way was open.

Cold night air washed over his face, so cold it burned his lungs. Stars overhead—impossible, beautiful. The forest smelled of pine and wet earth and *freedom*. His eyes watered from the sudden cold.

"Move," Whisper urged, claws digging in. "*Now*, before they realize."

Theron slipped through the broken grate, feet finding purchase on the rocky outcrop beyond—rough stone, still warm from the day's sun, a shocking contrast to dungeon cold. Cold night air hit him like a slap—sharp, clean, *free*. He steadied himself against the cliff face, breathing hard, taking stock of his surroundings. His whole body trembled—cold, exhaustion, adrenaline.

The drainage grate opened onto a steep ravine. Below, perhaps twenty feet down, he could see three possible paths:

**The Forest** — Dense woodland stretched to his left, dark pines and twisted oaks creating a maze of shadows. His phantom thralls were still crashing through there somewhere, confused and angry. But the trees would provide cover. Eventually.

**The Old Road** — To his right, winding down the ravine's edge, a pale ribbon of packed earth caught the moonlight. A road meant civilization. Villages. Help. But roads were also *exposed*. Easy to follow. Easy to track.

**The River** — Directly below, cutting through the ravine's base like a silver scar, black water rushed southward with urgent purpose. He could hear it from here—a constant roar, the sound of violence and speed. Swift, cold, relentless. The spray rose high enough that he could feel the mist on his face, taste the mineral bite of snowmelt.

Whisper's claws tightened on his shoulder.

"Three paths, wizard. Choose quickly. The thralls will realize the deception any moment."

Theron's thumb worked across his fingers—index, middle, ring, pinky—as his mind raced through the options, weighing survival against speed.

"The forest," he said, analyzing aloud. "Provides cover. Multiple concealment points—"

"—and eyes *everywhere*." Whisper's voice was sharp. "Her familiars nest in those trees. Ravens. Owls. Things worse than me. You'd be spotted within a hundred paces. She'd have thralls surrounding you before dawn."

"The road, then. Higher velocity of escape. Distance from her territorial control—"

"Also gets you *seen*. Roads connect. That means travelers. Farmers. Villagers." The rat's whiskers brushed his ear. "And some of them belong to her. Cultists. Informants. You're a wizard in torn robes with no spellbook, running from Thornhollow. How long before word reaches her? An hour? Two?"

Theron stared down at the rushing water. The sound of it filled the ravine—not quite a roar, but close.

"The river," he said slowly, precisely. "You're recommending the water route. Explain your reasoning."

"I'm suggesting the path she won't expect. The one that makes you *invisible*." Whisper's tone was matter-of-fact. "Water masks scent—the thralls track by smell, and you'll leave none. Water muffles sound—no footprints, no broken branches, nothing to follow. And water flows *away*—downstream, toward warmer lands, toward civilization she doesn't control."

"The temperature," Theron pointed out, academic even under duress. "That's snowmelt. I observed it from the cell window—the clarity, the speed. Hypothermia will be as lethal as her thralls."

"Maybe. But cold is *slow*. Thralls are *fast*." The rat shifted, claws pricking through fabric. "You're a wizard. You've survived worse than cold water. And the river runs parallel to the road—you'll see signs of civilization as you go. When you can't stand the cold anymore, climb out. But until then..."

Whisper's voice dropped to barely a whisper.

"The river makes you a ghost. And ghosts are hard to hunt."

Theron looked at each path again. The forest—swarming with her eyes. The road—a trail of breadcrumbs leading right to him. The river—brutal, freezing, but *anonymous*. His fingers found his belt again—still empty. No components. No backup plan. His robes were already damp from dungeon moisture. What was a little more water?

Behind them, distant in the tunnel system, he heard a screech. The thralls had realized. The sound echoed through the ravine, making birds scatter from the trees.

"The river," Theron said, decision made. "Your logic is sound. We proceed with the water route." He was already moving toward the ravine's edge, legs shaky, the descent treacherous. Loose stones skittered beneath his boots, tumbling down toward the churning water below.

"Wisely chosen." Whisper settled into his collar. "Hold your breath when we hit. And wizard?"

"What?"

"Try not to drop me in. I despise being submerged."

---

# Chapter 2: The River

Theron half-slid, half-scrambled down the ravine, loose stones skittering beneath his feet, sharp edges cutting through his worn boots. His hands scraped against rough stone, finding purchase where they could. The moonlight caught the water below: black and swift, cutting through the forest like a silver knife. Even from here, he could hear the roar of it, feel the spray misting his face.

"Can you swim?" Whisper asked, claws tightening.

"Can *you*?"

"I'm a rat. We're *excellent* swimmers. It's the cold I'm worried about."

Theron's thumb traced its familiar pattern across his fingers—index to pinky, thinking, calculating. The water would mask their scent. It was the right choice.

He hit the water and gasped—the cold was a physical shock, stealing his breath, stopping his heart for a terrifying moment. *Freezing* didn't capture it. This was snowmelt from the northern peaks, so cold it burned. His muscles seized. His lungs refused to work. For a moment, he thought he'd made a fatal mistake.

Then his body remembered how to breathe. How to move.

He found his footing on the rocky riverbed, stones slippery beneath his boots, the current tugging at his robes with surprising strength. The water was waist-deep here, chest-deep there as the river dipped and flowed. He pushed off, letting the flow carry him downstream, keeping his head low. His robes dragged at him, heavy with water. His teeth chattered uncontrollably. Whisper clung to his collar, tiny claws digging in desperately, nose just above the waterline, whiskers twitching with displeasure but no complaint.

Behind them, through the rush of water in his ears, the thralls' cries grew distant. Confused. They were chasing his phantom deeper into the forest, away from the water.

---

## Rest and Recovery

The river bent. Through the thinning canopy, he spotted it: the old road, a pale ribbon of packed earth running parallel to the water. And beyond—distant lights, warm and yellow. A village? A waystation? Hope, small but real.

Theron dragged himself onto the muddy bank, every muscle screaming in protest. His hands were numb, fumbling against the slick mud. He collapsed onto solid ground, shivering so violently his vision blurred. Water poured from his robes. His fingers were white, wrinkled, completely without feeling. His lips had gone numb. When he tried to stand, his legs barely held him. His hand automatically reached for his component pouch—and found nothing but empty belt. Right. The witch had it. He clenched his numb fist, feeling nothing.

Whisper shook himself dry with offended dignity, water spraying from his fur in droplets that caught the moonlight.

"Well, wizard. We're alive." The familiar surveyed the road, then him, whiskers dripping. "What's the plan? Rest and recover? Or push on through the night?"

The witch wouldn't stop hunting. But he was cold—*dangerously* cold, the kind that made thinking difficult—spent, and magically depleted. His hands trembled uncontrollably. He could barely stand.

Theron's thumb traced across his fingertips—index to pinky—calculating. Push through exhausted, or rest and risk being tracked?

"Whisper," he said through chattering teeth, already fumbling with the clasps of his sodden robes, "I need food. Anything."

The familiar fixed him with an unreadable look. "I'm your *familiar* now, not your servant."

A pause.

"...But I suppose if you die of hunger, our contract becomes rather meaningless."

He vanished into the undergrowth.

---

Theron found a hollow beneath an ancient oak—roots gnarled overhead like protective fingers, thick enough to block the wind and hide a small fire if he dared one. He didn't. Not tonight. Too risky.

He stripped down with numb fingers, his movements clumsy and slow. The wet fabric clung to his skin, resisting. He hung his robes over a low branch, wringing what water he could from the heavy fabric—it poured out in streams, soaking into the earth. The night air bit at his bare skin, raising goosebumps, but anything was better than wet cloth. He found dry leaves and moss to pile beneath the oak's shelter—the crackling leaves loud in the night silence, the moss slightly damp but better than nothing. He burrowed into the pile like an animal, pulling leaves over himself. Not warm, but warmer than the river. The earth smelled of rot and growing things.

As he worked, fragments of incantations slipped from his lips—half-remembered phrases from spells he could no longer cast. "*Lux... illuminare... protegere...*" The words felt hollow without his spellbook, without components. Just empty sounds, breath misting in the cold air. His teeth chattered between words.

Passable. He wouldn't freeze. Probably. His body heat was already warming the leaf-pile slightly. Small comfort.

---

Twenty minutes later, Whisper returned. He dropped his offering at Theron's feet with obvious pride:

Three acorns. A handful of wild blackberries, only slightly crushed, staining the rat's paws purple. And—improbably—half a bread roll, tooth-marked but edible.

"Found a traveler's dropped satchel upstream," he explained, whiskers twitching with satisfaction. "The bread was *already* bitten. Mostly."

Theron ate with shaking hands. The acorns were bitter, the blackberries tart and slightly fermented, the bread stale and crushed. It was the best meal he'd ever tasted. His stomach cramped around the food, desperate and grateful.

---

*He drifted into fitful sleep, curled beneath the oak, his familiar keeping watch with ancient, patient eyes.*

Morning would bring the road. The village. And decisions about what came next.

*The witch was still out there. She had his spellbook. His component pouch. And now, a grudge.*

---

**Dawn broke cold and grey.**

Theron woke stiff, every joint protesting, muscles aching from the river and the cold ground. Hungry again—the meager meal long burned through—but alive. His robes were damp but wearable, smelling of river water and mold. He sat up, leaves cascading off his shoulders, and his thumb began its automatic dance—index to pinky, index to pinky—as he considered the day ahead. His hand drifted to where his component pouch should hang. Empty. Always empty now. The absence was a constant ache.

Whisper sat on a root nearby, grooming his whiskers.

"The village is perhaps an hour's walk," he said. "I scouted ahead. It's small—tavern, smithy, chapel, a few farms. Nothing special." He paused. "There's also a notice board outside the tavern. Someone's posted a bounty."

His eyes glittered.

"For a *witch*."

---

## The Road to Millhaven

Theron pulled on his still-damp robes with a grimace—the fabric cold and clammy against his skin, making him shiver all over again—and set off toward the village, Whisper nestled in his hood, warm weight against his neck. The road was quiet—just birdsong and the distant lowing of cattle. His boots squelched with every step, still wet from the river. The morning air was crisp, smelling of dew and distant woodsmoke.

An hour later, legs aching, he crested a small hill and saw it: **Millhaven**. A humble cluster of thatched roofs and chimney smoke rising into the grey sky, exactly as Whisper had described. The sight made something in his chest loosen. Civilization. Warmth. Food. The tavern sat at the village's heart, a weathered sign creaking in the morning breeze.

*The Drowned Crow.*

Charming.

---

## The Tavern

Theron pushed through the door, the hinges creaking. Warmth washed over him like a blessing—blessed, wonderful warmth from a crackling hearth, making his cold-stiffened face tingle. The smell hit him next: bacon sizzling, fresh bread just out of the oven, yeasty and warm, the sharp tang of ale. His stomach cramped with sudden, desperate hunger. The murmur of early morning conversation was a comfort after the lonely night in the forest. A few heads turned: a farmer nursing an ale, two cloaked figures hunched over a map in the corner, a barmaid wiping down tables with rhythmic efficiency.

Behind the bar, a heavyset woman with kind eyes and flour-dusted arms looked him over, taking in his damp robes, disheveled appearance, and hollow-eyed exhaustion. Her expression softened.

"Rough night, traveler?"

"You could say that." His voice came out hoarse, throat raw from the cold river.

She grunted knowingly and slid a wooden menu across the bar, the wood worn smooth by countless hands.

---

**Breakfast at The Drowned Crow**

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Bacon, eggs, and black bread | 5 copper |
| Porridge with honey | 2 copper |
| Ale (morning strength) | 1 copper |
| Hot cider | 2 copper |

---

Theron checked his pockets. In the chaos of escape, he still had his coin purse—**14 copper and 3 silver**. The witch wanted his blood, not his money.

*He slid five copper and one more across the bar.*

"Bacon, eggs, black bread. And an ale."

The barkeep nodded approvingly. "A proper breakfast. Find a seat—Marta will bring it out."

He chose a table near the hearth, positioning himself with his back to the wall and a clear view of the room. Whisper slipped from his hood and disappeared beneath the table, invisible to casual observers.

"The two in the corner," the familiar whispered from below. "They smell like steel and old blood. Professionals."

---

The food arrived on a wooden platter, steam rising from the eggs, bacon crackling-hot and fragrant. Theron ate slowly despite his hunger, savoring every bite—the salt and fat of the bacon, crispy at the edges; the richness of the yolk, breaking golden over the bread; the dark, hearty chew of the bread itself, slightly burnt crust and soft inside. The ale was weak but welcome, cool and yeasty, washing away the last chill of the river and the taste of old fear.

The meal restored him. Warmth spread through his limbs. The fog of exhaustion lifted, replaced by clear-headed awareness. Between bites, his thumb traced its pattern across his fingers, thinking through his options. No spellbook. No components. But perhaps... allies?

As he ate, he observed.

**The cloaked figures:**

One was a woman, mid-thirties by Theron's estimate. Her silver hair was pulled back in a tight warrior's braid—prematurely gray, he suspected, given her age. Sharp gray-blue eyes tracked movement in the room with a soldier's constant assessment—door, windows, exits, the barmaid's knife belt, back to the door. A prominent scar ran from her left temple down to her jaw, cutting through what had once been a striking face. She wore practical leather armor beneath a dark traveling cloak, and her hands—visible as she traced routes on the map—showed the calluses and scars of someone who'd spent years with a sword.

As she spoke, her fingers found a silver locket at her throat, thumb pressing against its surface. Stressed about something. Her free hand adjusted the sword at her hip, checking the draw, then she rolled her shoulders—once, twice—settling tension that never quite left.

The other was a man around forty, built like a siege tower—broad-shouldered and heavy with the kind of muscle that came from labor, not vanity. His head was clean-shaven, practical for combat. Dark skin, close-cropped beard going gray at the edges, and watchful dark eyes that absorbed everything while revealing nothing. A heavy crossbow leaned against the wall beside him, positioned within easy reach. When he shifted, moving with surprising quiet for his size, Theron caught a glimpse of an old scar on his neck just above his collar.

His chair was positioned at an angle—not beside the woman, but slightly behind and to her left. Protecting her back. Deliberate. His thick fingers rested on the crossbow's tension mechanism: *click-click-click*, a rhythmic, unconscious testing. He listened more than he spoke, but his silence felt deliberate, not empty.

Their conversation was low, but he caught fragments:

*"...Thornhollow's been active again..."*

*"...the bounty's good but the last crew never came back..."*

*"...need better intel before we move..."*

The man went utterly still, head tilted slightly. Listening. Not to the conversation—to something else. The room. The sounds beyond the walls. Then, satisfied, he resumed that rhythmic clicking of the crossbow mechanism.

The woman glanced up. Her eyes met his for a half-second—assessing, calculating—then returned to the map.

Whisper's voice floated up. "They're discussing *her*. The witch."

Theron's pulse quickened. These could be allies. Or competition. Or worse—bounty hunters who might see him as leverage.

*Careful. Trust is a luxury you can't afford yet.*

Still, they were planning something against the witch. And he needed allies—someone who knew the terrain, who had resources.

Someone who might help him get his spellbook back.

# Chapter 3: The Drowned Crow

## Intelligence Gathering

Theron mopped up the last of the egg yolk with his bread, then rose casually and returned to the bar. The tavern smelled of woodsmoke, bacon grease, and stale ale—familiar, almost comforting after days in the witch's dungeon. The barkeep was drying tankards with a rag, the fabric making soft squeaking sounds against the pewter.

He leaned against the counter, feeling the warmth from the kitchen fire on his left side, keeping his voice low beneath the murmur of morning conversations around him.

"I have a question, if you don't mind. Those two in the corner—are they regulars here?"

She glanced past him, then back. Her expression didn't change, but something flickered behind her eyes—caution, maybe respect for his discretion.

"Regulars enough. They've been through Millhaven three, four times this season." She set down a tankard. "Hunters. The dangerous kind. Not bandits or beasts—they hunt *worse* things."

"What's your assessment of their competence?"

A dry laugh. "They're still alive, aren't they? The woman's called **Sera Vex**. Used to be a soldier—officer, I heard, before something went sour. The big fellow's **Tomren**. Doesn't talk much. Doesn't need to, with that crossbow of his."

She leaned closer, voice dropping.

"Word is they've been poking around Thornhollow for weeks. Asking questions. Mapping the forest." Her eyes narrowed. "You're the second person this month to stumble in here looking like they crawled out of a grave. The last one..."

She trailed off.

"The last one what?"

"Didn't make it through the night. Fever took him. Kept mumbling about a witch and something she'd *summoned*."

Whisper shifted beneath his collar.

*The barkeep studied him with newfound interest.*

"You've got that same look, stranger. But you're still standing." She nodded toward the corner. "If you know something about what's up in those woods—those two are your best bet. Just..."

She hesitated.

"Don't waste their time. Sera doesn't suffer fools."

---

## First Contact

Theron approached the table with unhurried steps, hands visible, posture open—no threat here, just a traveler. His still-damp robes clung uncomfortably to his shoulders. Sera's eyes tracked him the moment he left the bar, sharp and assessing. Tomren's hand drifted toward the crossbow, then stopped. Waiting. The fire crackled behind them, casting shifting shadows across their faces.

"Apologies for the interruption," Theron said, voice calm. "I overheard you mention Thornhollow. May I ask—are you planning an expedition there?"

Sera's scarred face remained unreadable. "Lots of people mention Thornhollow. It's the local nightmare. Doesn't mean we're holding auditions."

"I'm not seeking employment. I'm offering intelligence in exchange for mutual benefit."

A flicker of interest. Tomren glanced at Sera.

Theron continued, measured. His left thumb rubbed across his fingertips in sequence—index to pinky, a habit from years of component work. Thinking. Calculating the approach. "I was in those woods recently. Saw things. The kind of information that might be useful to people planning an assault."

Sera leaned back, arms crossed. "And what makes you think we're planning anything?"

He paused, choosing his words. "You've been scouting for weeks. That's not bounty-hunting methodology. That's tactical preparation for a sustained operation."

*Silence. The fire crackled, and somewhere in the kitchen, pots clanged against stone. Outside, a cart rattled past on the muddy street.*

Sera's hand moved unconsciously to the silver chain at her throat, thumb tracing the outline of the locket hidden beneath. A split-second tell—stress, decision-making. Tomren's fingers found his crossbow, making the smallest adjustment to the tension mechanism. *Click-click.* The sound barely audible above the tavern's ambient noise. Thinking.

They exchanged a look. Some unspoken communication passed between them, years of partnership in a single glance.

"Sit," she said finally, her hand dropping from the locket. "Hands visible."

Theron sat, placing his hands flat on the rough wooden table. The surface was scarred and sticky with spilled ale. His fingers twitched toward his component pouch—empty, stolen—before he caught himself. The absence still felt wrong, like a missing tooth his tongue kept probing.

"I'm Theron. The rat on my shoulder is Whisper."

Sera's eyes flicked to the familiar, then back. "Wizard?"

"Was. Currently between spellbooks."

That got a reaction—a slight raise of her eyebrow. A wizard without a spellbook was like a soldier without a sword.

Sera Vex. Tomren." She leaned forward. "What did you see in Thornhollow? Specific numbers."

Theron chose his words carefully. His thumb moved again—index, middle, ring, pinky. Thinking. "Let me think... Thralls. At least a dozen. Cultists—organized, armed. And something else. Something she's summoned. I didn't get a good look, but..." He met her eyes. "It's worse than the stories say."

Sera's jaw tightened, her hand finding the locket again. Tomren's crossbow clicked softly as he adjusted the tension. Both processing the threat assessment.

"You were inside?" Sera asked, voice sharp. "Inside the castle?"

"I was detained. Held against my will for—" He paused, calculating. "Approximately seventy-two hours. I effected my escape through the eastern drainage system."

"How many guards?"

"Three patrols in that sector. I avoided direct confrontation."

Sera studied him for a long moment. Her eyes tracked his posture, his hands, the way he held himself. Soldier's assessment—counting exits, measuring threats, evaluating assets. *Assess. Adapt. Act.* Looking for lies, for madness, for anything that would mark him as useless or dangerous.

*He let her look.*

Finally, she leaned back. "We should talk. Not here. Too many ears." She glanced toward the window, where villagers passed by outside. Already counting how many ears, how many potential problems. "Storage barn. East side. Eighteen hundred hours."

"May I ask why the delay?"

"I need to verify you are who you say you are. And you decide if you trust us." Her eyes were cold. "Take the day. Show up at dusk, we talk terms."

Theron nodded slowly. Fair enough. She was careful. That was good—it meant she might actually survive what they were planning.

He rose from the table.

"Dusk, then."

---

## The Long Afternoon

Theron spent the rest of the day in Millhaven, keeping a low profile. He bought a few supplies with his remaining coin—dried meat, a waterskin, a small knife. Nothing that would draw attention.

Whisper scouted, reporting back periodically.

"Sera visited the village elder. Asked about recent disappearances. The numbers are... concerning." The rat's whiskers twitched. "Three villagers in the last month. All young. All vanished without a trace."

"The witch is accelerating," Theron murmured.

"Or preparing something big."

That thought sat heavy in his gut. If she was gathering power for a ritual—if she had his spellbook, his component pouch, and fresh victims—

*What is she planning?*

And somewhere, buried in the back of his mind: *Did Lucian make it here? Did he see this castle before—*

He pushed the thought away. He'd find out. Once he was inside again, once he could search properly—

"Theron," Whisper's voice cut through his spiraling thoughts. "Two riders approaching. From the north."

He turned, casually glancing toward the road.

Two figures on horseback, wearing dark robes marked with symbols he recognized.

*The witch's cultists.*

His blood went cold.

---

## Unwelcome Visitors

The cultists rode into the village square with the easy confidence of armed travelers, hoofbeats thudding on the packed dirt. Their horses were lathered with sweat, smelling of exertion and fear. The villagers stopped what they were doing, eyes following the strangers with a mixture of curiosity and caution. A woman pulled her child closer. A blacksmith's hammer went silent mid-strike.

*Armed riders. Dark robes. Symbols on their cloaks—old symbols, the kind that made people uneasy.* The horses stamped and snorted, leather creaking as the riders shifted in their saddles.

Most villagers returned to their business after a moment, keeping a wary distance. Just travelers, probably. Dangerous ones, maybe mercenaries or pilgrims from the old castle ruins up north. Nothing to do with them.

But inside the tavern, the barkeep's face went pale. She knew those symbols.

One cultist dismounted—a tall woman with a shaved head and a brand on her cheek. The other remained mounted, hand on his sword hilt.

The village elder approached slowly, uncertain but trying to maintain his authority.

"Travelers?" he asked carefully. "The inn has rooms, if you need lodging—"

"We're not here for lodging," the woman said, voice carrying across the square. "We're looking for someone. A stranger. Arrived this morning, probably soaked and exhausted."

Theron's heart hammered, pulse loud in his ears. Sweat prickled cold down his spine despite the afternoon warmth. *They know.*

His hand moved instinctively to his component pouch—still empty, still stolen. The absence felt like missing a limb. He was standing near the blacksmith's shop, the smell of hot iron and coal smoke thick in the air. Partially hidden by a stack of barrels, he could feel splinters catching on his damp robes. Slowly, carefully, he began backing into the shadows, each step measured to avoid sound.

"A stranger?" the elder stammered. "We get travelers sometimes, but—"

"A wizard," the cultist clarified. "Escaped from the Lady's hospitality. She's... displeased." A cold smile. "Anyone who provides information will be rewarded. Anyone who hides him will burn."

The square had gone silent. Villagers exchanged fearful glances.

The cultist's eyes swept the crowd—

And landed on the tavern.

"Search there first," she ordered her companion. "Check every room. If you find him, take him alive. The Lady has questions."

Whisper's claws dug into Theron's shoulder. "Run. Now."

But before he could move, the tavern door burst open.

Sera Vex stepped out, crossbow in hand.

No wizard here. And you're not welcome.

The cultists turned. The woman's hand went to her sword.

"Sera Vex," she said, recognition dawning. "Still searching for your lost daughter? The Lady wondered when you'd gather the courage to knock on her door."

Sera's expression didn't change, but Theron saw her knuckles whiten on the crossbow. Her free hand moved fractionally toward the locket at her throat—then stopped, forced back down. Control. Discipline.

Leave. Before I decide you're worth the bolt.

The cultist laughed. "You're outnumbered, soldier. There are more of us in the woods. One shout and—"

Tomren appeared in the tavern doorway behind Sera, his own crossbow raised. The faint *click-click* of the tension mechanism being adjusted—habit, precision, readiness.

"Make that two crossbows."

The cultists hesitated.

And in that moment, the mounted one's eyes flicked across the square—

And locked onto Theron.

"There!" he shouted, pointing. "The wizard!"

*Damn.*

---

## The Fight

Everything happened at once.

The female cultist drew her sword, steel rasping against the scabbard. Sera fired—the crossbow's *twang* sharp in the tense air. The bolt took the mounted cultist in the shoulder with a wet *thunk*, spinning him from his horse. He hit the ground hard, the impact raising dust. His horse bolted, hooves clattering on stone. Tomren was already reloading, the mechanical *click-click-click* of the mechanism fast and practiced.

The remaining cultist charged Sera with a roar, boots pounding the earth.

Theron stepped out from the shadows, raising his hand. His palm burned as he pulled power from nothing. No spellbook. No components. Just will and words and the dregs of his power.

"*Flamma!*"

Fire burst from his palm—not a full *Firebolt*, but enough. The heat scorched his own skin. The flames caught the charging cultist across the face with a whoosh of igniting cloth, and she screamed, stumbling. The smell of burnt hair and flesh hit him, acrid and sickening.

Sera didn't waste the opening. She dropped the crossbow with a clatter, drew a short sword, and closed the distance in three steps. Steel met steel with a sharp *clang* that rang across the square. Sparks flew from the impact.

The wounded cultist was struggling to his feet, blood streaming from his shoulder and dripping into the dust. The copper smell of blood mixed with horse sweat. Tomren's second bolt took him in the leg with another meaty *thunk*, and he went down with a cry of pain and rage.

Theron circled wide, hands ready to cast again if needed. His power was nearly spent, but he could manage one more cantrip if Sera needed help.

Sera and the female cultist traded blows—fast, brutal, efficient. Steel rang against steel, each impact jarring up through Sera's arm. Their boots scraped and slid on the packed earth, kicking up dust. The cultist was good, breathing hard through gritted teeth, but Sera was *better*. A feint, a parry, muscles burning with exertion, and then Sera's blade found flesh—sliding between ribs with a sound like cutting through leather. The cultist gasped, stumbling back, hand pressed to her side. Blood welled between her fingers, hot and dark.

"Yield. Now," Sera commanded, her own breath coming hard, sweat dripping down her temple despite the cool air.

The cultist spat blood, the spray hitting the dirt. "The Lady will—"

Sera's pommel struck her temple with a dull crack. The cultist collapsed, limbs going slack.

Silence fell over the square. In the sudden stillness, Theron could hear his own ragged breathing, smell the blood and burnt flesh, feel his legs trembling with adrenaline's aftermath.

Villagers stared, wide-eyed. Some terrified. Some... hopeful?

Sera looked at Theron, then at the two unconscious cultists.

Well. Guess we're having that conversation now."

---

## Flight

"Need to move. More cultists in the woods." Tomren was already binding the cultists' hands.

"They'll come looking." Sera turned to the elder. "Get these people inside. Bar the doors. More cultists come, tell them we went south toward Dunmere."

"But—"

"*Do it.*"

The elder nodded shakily.

Sera grabbed her pack from inside the tavern, Tomren right behind her. She looked at Theron.

You're coming with us. No arguments. That fight made you our asset."

"I didn't ask—"

"Don't care. You know Thornhollow's interior. Strategic value." Her eyes were hard. "Witch knows you're here. We're all on borrowed time." She started toward the village edge. "Move now. Plan at rally point."

Theron glanced at Whisper. The rat's expression was unreadable.

"She's right," the familiar murmured. "And honestly? We could do worse for allies."

*Could we do better?*

No time to wonder.

Theron followed Sera and Tomren into the forest.

---

## Into the Woods

They moved fast, putting distance between themselves and Millhaven. Branches whipped at Theron's face, leaving stinging scratches. His lungs burned, legs aching from the pace. Sera led with the confidence of someone who'd scouted these woods a hundred times, never breaking stride over roots or through undergrowth. Behind them, Tomren brought up the rear, crossbow ready, his breathing barely labored despite the pace. Eyes scanning for pursuit.

Theron kept pace, sweat soaking through his already-damp robes, his borrowed sword bouncing awkwardly at his hip with every stride. The forest smelled of pine and damp earth, cooler in the shade of the canopy.

After an hour, Sera called a halt near a small stream. The sound of running water was immediately soothing after the pounding of their boots on forest floor. They were deep in the forest now, surrounded by old growth and shadow. Birds called overhead—returning after the disturbance of their passage. The temperature had dropped; Theron's sweat-soaked clothes made him shiver.

Here." Sera pointed to a dense thicket. "Two hours rest. Move at twenty-one hundred."

She pulled out her map, spreading it on a flat stone still damp with moss. The paper crinkled softly. Tomren took up a watch position against a broad oak, facing back the way they'd come, his crossbow resting across his knees.

Theron sat heavily on the forest floor, breathing hard, each breath tasting of pine resin and his own exhaustion. His muscles ached—thighs burning, calves cramping. His damp robes chafed at neck and underarms, the fabric scratching against skin with every movement. His hands trembled slightly, adrenaline still working through his system. But he was alive. The forest floor was surprisingly soft beneath him—layers of moss and old leaves, slightly damp but better than stone.

Sera studied him across the map.

"Assessment time. Why does the witch deploy active pursuit for one escaped prisoner?"

Theron met her eyes. This was the moment. Trust or suspicion. Alliance or alone.

He thought of Lucian. Of the journal entry he'd someday find. Of the truth he needed.

"Let me think." He paused. "I don't know. I was detained like any other prisoner. But..." He hesitated. "I came to Thornhollow searching for someone. My son. He disappeared eight years ago—precisely eight years, two months—chasing rumors of a witch who could teach him magic."

Sera's expression softened—just slightly. Understanding.

"You think he found her," she said quietly.

"I think he might have. And if he did..." Theron's voice roughened, becoming more precise despite the emotion. "I need to establish what happened. Find him, or—" He stopped. "Or at least confirm his status. One way or another."

Sera was silent for a moment. Then she reached up and pulled the silver locket from beneath her cloak.

Elina. My daughter. Sixteen. Taken six months ago." She opened the locket, showing a small painted portrait—a young woman with dark eyes and Sera's sharp features. "Witch has her. Don't know why. Don't know if she's alive. Going to find out."

Their eyes met across the map.

Two parents. Two missing children. Two impossible rescues.

Tomren's gruff voice broke the silence.

"I owe Sera twice over. She asked for help, and I didn't hesitate." He didn't turn from his watch. "Your son. Her daughter. We're going in regardless."

Sera extended her hand across the map.

Provisional alliance. Joint operation. Mutual objectives." Her scarred face was serious. "Mission priority: intelligence, extraction, survival. Betray us, threat neutralization is immediate."

Theron looked at her hand. At Tomren's solid presence. At the map marking paths to Thornhollow.

He clasped her hand.

"Agreed."

Whisper sighed from his shoulder.

"Well. This is either brilliantly strategic or phenomenally stupid." The rat's whiskers twitched. "Knowing you lot, probably both."

---

*They rested until dusk, then moved deeper into the forest, away from Millhaven, away from pursuit.*

*Behind them, in the village square, the two bound cultists were beginning to wake.*

*And in Thornhollow castle, the witch raised her head, sensing disturbance in the threads of her web.*

*The wizard lived. And now he'd found allies.*

*How... interesting.*

---

# Chapter 4: The Planning

Sera released his hand and smoothed the map flat against the stone surface, the parchment crinkling softly beneath her palms.

"Now we plan properly." She secured the corners with small rocks—rough stones still warm from the sun—keeping the parchment from curling. "We've been gathering intelligence for weeks, but it's all external. Patrol routes. Supply lines. The castle's silhouette." She tapped the parchment, her fingernail making a sharp sound against the paper. "You're the first person to make it out of there alive and lucid. So."

She slid the map toward him, the paper rasping against stone.

"Show us everything. Entrances. Exits. Guard positions. Where she keeps prisoners. Where she works." Her eyes glinted. "And tell us about this *summoning*. What came through?"

---

## The Layout

*Theron pulled the map closer, studying its edges. Sera's cartography was meticulous—the castle's exterior, the treeline, the river he knew all too well. But the interior was blank. Waiting.* His left thumb moved across his fingertips in sequence—index to pinky, then back again—as he considered where to begin.

"Do you have charcoal? A quill?"

Tomren produced a stick of graphite from his pack, the charcoal leaving dark smudges on his fingers. Theron took it—the graphite smooth and cool—and began to sketch.

He traced a preliminary line on the parchment, the graphite scratching softly. "The castle has three levels that I know of. Possibly more."

His hand moved across the parchment, roughing in shapes from memory. The smell of graphite mixed with the forest scents around them—pine and moss and stream water.

"The dungeons are the lowest. Cells here, here, and here." He marked Xs. "Mine was the third on the left. Stone walls, iron bars, old but solid. There's a central corridor that runs the length of the dungeon, lit by torches that never seem to burn out."

"Enchanted?" Sera asked.

"Almost certainly."

Theron traced a line downward.

"Below the main dungeon level, there's a drainage system. Old tunnels—pre-dates the castle, I think. This is how I escaped." He marked the grate's position. "The ironwork was rusted. One of her thralls broke it down chasing an illusion."

A faint smirk from Tomren.

"The tunnels branch extensively. Without a guide, you'd be lost within minutes. Some passages are collapsed. At least one leads to an oubliette—Whisper warned me away from it."

The familiar spoke up from his shoulder. "Deep pit. Old bones at the bottom. She throws failures down there."

Sera's jaw tightened, muscles jumping beneath her scarred cheek. Her hand moved unconsciously to the locket at her throat, gripping it. She was thinking of Elina. When she breathed, it came out shaky.

---

Theron continued, sketching upward now.

"Above the dungeons, a spiral staircase connects to what I believe is the main level. I didn't see it directly, but I heard the ritual coming from above. The acoustics suggest a large central chamber—great hall, perhaps, or a converted throne room."

"That's where she'd work," Whisper added. "She likes theatrical spaces. Room for circles. Altars. Audiences."

"What kind of audiences?" Tomren asked.

"She talks to *something*. Always has. Whether it listens..." The rat shrugged, disturbingly human. "Who knows?"

Theron marked the probable location of the ritual chamber.

"Her study is somewhere on this level as well. That's where my spellbook will be—she'd want to examine it, learn what I know. Witches covet other practitioners' secrets."

"And the component pouch?" Sera asked.

His hand moved reflexively to his belt, reaching for the familiar weight—but found only empty leather loops. The absence felt like a missing tooth. "On her person. She was wearing it when I heard her voice from above."

---

## The Defenses

Theron set down the graphite and leaned back.

"Thralls. At least three, possibly more. Human once—or close enough. They move wrong. Jerky, like puppets with tangled strings. They don't speak, but they *track*. By scent, I think. Maybe sound."

"Can they be killed?" Tomren asked, hand resting on his crossbow. His fingers found the tension mechanism—*click-click-click*—adjusting it with practiced precision.

"What do you mean by 'killed'?" Theron asked. "They're not undead, if that's what you're asking. They bleed. A bolt to the head would put one down, I'd wager." He paused. "But they're *fast* when they want to be. And they don't seem to feel pain."

Sera nodded grimly. "We've dealt with enthralled before. Standard suppression tactics—immobilize the legs, then neutralize."

Theron continued.

"There's also her familiar network. Or there *was*." He glanced at Whisper. "She keeps eyes and ears throughout the castle. Rats, ravens, spiders—small creatures bound to her will. They report back. If one sees you, she knows."

"Present company excluded," Whisper said drily.

"Can you identify the others?" Sera asked the rat directly.

"Some. Not all. She's had centuries to build her web." Whisper's whiskers twitched. "But I know which ones are truly loyal and which are merely... *bound*. There may be opportunities for misdirection."

Sera absorbed this. "Threat assessment—magical defenses? Wards? Alarms?"

"The silver key," he said. "In the dungeon, there were three keys. One opened my cell. One—the silver one, with runes—triggers an alarm if used. I don't know what the bone-white key does, and I didn't ask."

Tomren grunted approval.

"Assume wards on every significant entrance. The main doors, her study, the ritual chamber. I can't tell you specifics without examining them, but a witch of her power wouldn't leave herself exposed."

---

## The Summoning

The forest around them felt colder suddenly, despite the afternoon sun. The stream seemed quieter. Even the birds had gone silent, as if sensing the weight of the conversation.

"I didn't see it directly," he admitted, throat tightening at the memory. "I was in the tunnels when it happened. But I *felt* it." His hands trembled slightly.

Theron searched for words adequate to the memory. Under his breath, barely audible: "*Praesidium... fortis animus...*" Fragment of a warding incantation, unconscious comfort.

"The chanting stopped. Then—a sound. Like reality being torn. Fabric ripping, but *deeper*. It resonated in my bones, my teeth. Made them ache." He shook his head, rubbing his jaw at the phantom pain. "And then her voice changed. Layered. As if something else was speaking *through* her. Or *with* her."

Sera's face had gone pale, the scar standing out livid against her skin. She gripped the stone table edge, knuckles white.

"What did it say?"

"'The binding is complete. Now... where is my sacrifice?'"

Silence.

Tomren's hand tightened on his crossbow.

"She's bound something," he continued. "Something powerful enough to require a sacrifice. Something that can speak through her." He looked at Whisper. "Do you know what it might be?"

The familiar was quiet for a long moment.

"She's been researching for decades. Collecting texts. Obsessing over old names." His voice was unusually subdued. "There were three entities she spoke of most often. Three she believed could be bound, if the price was paid."

He met his eyes.

"**Vaelthar the Unraveler**—a demon of entropy. It consumes magical bonds, unweaves enchantments. Dangerous to casters, but relatively containable."

"**Morreth, the Choir of Wounds**—not one being but many, fused together. It speaks with borrowed voices and feeds on pain. Harder to kill because there's no single point of failure."

"Or..."

Whisper hesitated.

"**Szeth-Kaan, the Herald of Empty Thrones.**"

Even the name felt wrong in his ears, tasted bitter on his tongue. The temperature seemed to drop. Sera shivered visibly, arms wrapping around herself.

"What is that?" she asked, voice smaller than before.

"Old. Very old. A thing from before the gods carved their names into the world. It doesn't want worship. It doesn't want souls." Whisper's voice dropped to a whisper. "It wants *endings*. Kingdoms. Bloodlines. Legacies. It erases things from history so completely that no one remembers they existed."

The fire crackled.

"If she's bound Szeth-Kaan..." The familiar trailed off. "Then the sacrifice isn't a person. It's a *place*. A village. A family line. Something with roots."

Sera's hand moved to the locket at her throat, fingers trembling as they found the chain.

---

The forest sounds seemed distant, muffled. Theron could hear his own heartbeat, loud in his ears.

Sera spoke first, her voice rough.

"Then we don't have weeks. We might not even have days." She looked at him. "Can you tell which one it is? From what you heard?"

*Theron closed his eyes, reaching back into the memory. The sound. The voice. The way the air tasted—ozone and old blood.*

"The layered voice," he said slowly. "It wasn't a chorus. It was singular, but *fractured*. Like one speaker echoing through broken mirrors."

Whisper nodded. "That rules out Morreth. The Choir speaks in true multiplicity—dozens of voices at once, overlapping. What you heard was one entity, fragmented."

"And the feeling when it arrived. Not unraveling. Not dissolution." He pressed his palm flat against the stone, remembering. "It felt like *erasure*. Like the space where the ritual happened was being... edited. Removed from the world's memory even as it occurred."

Sera's face had gone ashen.

"Szeth-Kaan," Whisper confirmed, his voice barely audible. "The Herald of Empty Thrones."

---

Tomren broke it, his gravelly voice cutting through the dread.

"So we're fighting a witch and some ancient god-thing. Wonderful."

"Not a god," Whisper corrected. "Older than gods. Gods have egos, desires, worshippers. Szeth-Kaan is more like... a function. A cosmic editor. It removes things that have grown too *loud* in the weave of history."

"And the witch summoned it *why*?" Sera demanded.

"Power. Revenge. Immortality." The familiar shrugged. "The usual reasons. But Szeth-Kaan doesn't grant wishes. It makes *bargains*. She must have offered it something it wanted."

"The sacrifice," he said. "A place. A bloodline."

His eyes met Sera's.

"Millhaven."

---

The word fell like a stone into still water.

Sera rose abruptly, boots scraping against stone. She moved away from the map, staring through the trees toward where Millhaven lay hidden—the farmers starting their day, children running past, smoke rising from chimneys. Her breathing was ragged, fists clenched at her sides.

"How long?" she asked without turning.

Whisper calculated. "The binding is complete, but Szeth-Kaan doesn't act immediately. It savors. Studies. Learns the shape of what it will erase." A pause. "Three days, perhaps. Maybe less if she's accelerating the process."

"Three days to stop a witch and a primordial entity." Tomren's voice was flat.

---

## The Disagreement

Sera turned back to face them, and the grief in her eyes had hardened into something sharper. Purpose. She rolled her shoulders once—a fighter's reflex before confrontation, joints popping softly.

"My daughter is in that castle. This village—these people—they're in the operational area." She planted both hands on the map, palms flat against the stone, the impact making a solid thump. Her eyes scanned automatically: trees for cover, the stream for retreat, angles of approach. "We're not waiting. We're not scouting further. We move at nightfall."

Tomren's expression darkened, jaw setting. "That's suicide with what we have."

"It's operational necessity." Sera's voice was steel, but Theron could hear the tremor beneath it. "Every hour we delay, Szeth-Kaan gets stronger. Every hour, Elina—" Her voice caught, breath hitching. "We don't *have* time to wait."

"We don't have the *resources* to rush," Tomren countered, his usual calm fraying at the edges. "We need better equipment. More intelligence. Maybe we find other hunters, build a proper strike team—"

"There's no time for that!" Sera's voice rose, echoing through the forest. Birds scattered from nearby trees. "While we're building your strike team, that thing erases Millhaven from existence. Elina disappears. Everyone here *forgets they ever lived*."

If we die unprepared, everyone dies. Your daughter included.

The tension cracked like lightning between them. The air felt charged, dangerous. Tomren's hand had drifted toward his crossbow. Sera's fingers brushed her sword hilt.

Theron raised a hand, palm out. "Both of you. Stop."

They turned to him, breathing hard, chests heaving. The stream burbled in the sudden silence.

Theron's voice was measured, precise. "Tomren's right that we need to be smart about this. But Sera's also right that we're on a clock. The question isn't *whether* we go tonight—it's *how* we go." He looked between them. "We have hours, not days. So we use those hours wisely. Gather what we can. Plan properly. Then move."

Sera's jaw worked, grinding audibly. Her hand released the sword hilt with visible effort. She nodded stiffly.

Tomren exhaled slowly, a long breath that seemed to release the tension from his shoulders. "Then we need a real plan."

"Agreed." Theron pulled the map closer. "Which brings us to the harder question."

"Which is?" Sera asked.

"What exactly do you mean by 'primary objective'?" He looked at each of them. "Because I see three goals here, and they might not be compatible."

---

## Conflicting Priorities

The weight of the question hung heavy between them.

Sera spoke first, voice tight. "Elina. We find her, we get her out. That's why I'm here."

"And alert the witch? Trigger every alarm in the castle?"

"Then we fight through it."

"Then we die." Tomren shook his head, going utterly still as he absorbed the strategic implications. A hunter listening to the forest. "We blow our surprise, we're dead. The ritual continues anyway."

"Don't." Sera's voice was dangerous. "Don't tell me to sacrifice my daughter for 'the greater good.'"

"We need to prioritize the threats." Tomren leaned forward. "Biggest threat is Szeth-Kaan, not the witch. Disrupt the binding first, then extract the girl."

"By which time she could be dead!" Sera's hand moved to her sword hilt, adjusting its position on her belt with practiced tension. "Or worse—used as a sacrifice."

Theron cleared his throat. "There's also the matter of my spellbook."

They both turned to stare at him.

"Your *spellbook*?" Sera's voice was incredulous. "That's your priority right now?"

"Hear me out." Theron kept his voice level. "I'm operating at maybe ten percent of my capability. Cantrips and tricks. Against a witch who has decades of experience and a bound demon?" He shook his head. "I'm barely useful. But if I can recover my spellbook—if I can get even a few minutes to study and prepare proper spells—I could be the difference between victory and everyone dying."

"He's not wrong," Whisper added from his shoulder. "A prepared wizard is worth ten armed soldiers in a fight like this."

"That's a delay we can't afford," Tomren pointed out. "How long to find it? How long to search through traps?"

"Then I deal with the traps. That's what wizards do." Theron met Sera's eyes. "I'm not saying abandon Elina. I'm saying if we go in there with me at a fraction of my power, we're more likely to *fail* to save her."

Sera's expression was anguished. "So what, we leave her in a cell while you browse through books?"

"Twenty minutes," Theron said. "Maybe less if the study isn't heavily trapped. And in exchange, you get a wizard who can actually contribute to the fight."

The silence was heavy.

Whisper spoke up quietly. "There's also the matter of *information*. Theron's spellbook might have notes. Records. Details about—" He glanced at Theron. "About previous visitors to the castle. People the witch has... processed."

Theron's throat tightened. Lucian. Whisper was talking about finding evidence of Lucian.

Sera saw it on his face. "This isn't just about power. You want answers."

"I want both." Theron didn't flinch from her gaze. "And yes, if there's a chance—even a slim one—that I can learn what happened to my son, I'm taking it. But that doesn't change the tactical reality. We *need* my spellbook if we're going to win."

---

## The Compromise

Tomren rubbed his face with both hands. "Three objectives. Rescue the girl, recover the spellbook, stop the ritual." He looked up. "Against thralls, a witch, and a bound entity. All in maybe three hours."

"We split up," Sera said.

"No." Tomren's response was immediate. "That's how people die."

"Then we *choose*," Sera interrupted. "What comes first. What's most important."

The question hung between them like a blade.

"Let me think through this tactically." His thumb moved across his fingertips again—index, middle, ring, pinky—each contact point marking a variable in the equation. The drainage tunnels came up near the dungeons. Elina was likely imprisoned there. His spellbook was in the study, which was probably on the main level. The ritual chamber—where Szeth-Kaan was summoned—was also main level, possibly higher.

"We can't do everything at once," he said slowly. "But we can sequence it smart. Use the castle's layout to our advantage."

He traced the map with one finger.

"We enter through the drainage tunnels. That puts us near the dungeons. We move fast, quiet. Find Elina, extract her. Get her *out* through the tunnels before we proceed."

"That's—" Sera started.

"I'm not finished." Theron continued. "Once she's safe—truly safe, outside the castle—Tomren escorts her to a fallback position. Maybe the forest's edge. Somewhere she can hide or run if things go wrong."

"Two of us against a witch and a demon?" Tomren's skepticism was palpable.

"No. You come back. But Elina is *secured* first. Not just rescued—*secured*. Extraction complete before we proceed." He looked at her. "You'll fight better knowing she's out. Won't you?"

Sera's jaw worked. Her thumb found the locket at her throat, tracing its outline once. Then she nodded reluctantly. "Affirmative."

"Then we move to the study. I retrieve my spellbook, prepare what I can. Fifteen minutes, tops." He met her eyes. "And if I find information about Lucian, I pocket it and keep moving. No delays."

"Can you do that?" she asked quietly. "If you find out your son died there—can you set it aside and keep fighting?"

The question cut deep. Theron thought about the oubliette. The bones at the bottom. The very real possibility that Lucian was among them.

"I've been searching for eight years," he said finally. "Eight years of not knowing. If I find proof—even the worst proof—at least I'll *know*." He straightened. "And knowing will free me to finish this properly. No more wondering. Just purpose."

Tomren grunted. "That's... surprisingly healthy for someone about to storm a nightmare castle."

"Or completely delusional," Whisper added. "But I appreciate the commitment."

Sera was watching Theron with new respect. "After the study. Then what?"

"Then we find the ritual chamber. Together, all three of us." Theron tapped the map where he'd marked the probable location. "We disrupt whatever the witch is doing. Banish Szeth-Kaan if we can, weaken it if we can't. And we end her."

He looked between them.

"Does that work? Can you live with that sequence?"

Tomren considered, then nodded. "Not perfect. But it's a plan."

Sera's hand moved to the locket at her throat. Her fingers traced its outline—once, twice.

"Elina first," she said. "Secure the extraction, establish a rally point. Then I don't care if we have to fight every demon in the Nine Hells." Her eyes were fierce. "I'll burn that castle down brick by brick."

"That's the spirit," Whisper said approvingly. "Pyromania always helps."

---

Theron felt the tension ease slightly. The air no longer crackled with potential violence. Sera's shoulders dropped a fraction. Tomren's hand moved away from his weapon.

She looked at him.

"You said you're a fraction of yourself without your spellbook. Can you still fight? Can you still *help*?"

---

Theron had cantrips. Minor Illusion. Message. Prestidigitation. Light. Mage Hand. Perhaps one or two others rattling around in his memory. No components. No focus. No prepared spells beyond what was burned into his mind.

But he also had Whisper—a familiar who knew the castle's secrets. He had knowledge the others lacked. And he had three days of fear and humiliation crystallized into something cold and determined.

*Theron rose to his feet, matching Sera's resolve.*

"I can fight. I'll need to be creative—but then again, I always do." He allowed himself a thin smile. "I've survived worse odds than this. Three days ago I was in chains. Now I'm planning an assault."

Sera's eyes flickered with something like approval.

"But," he continued, "I won't go to war empty-handed. Not if I can help it. Even basic components would double my effectiveness. A focus would triple it." He gestured back toward where Millhaven lay hidden through the trees. "Is there an apothecary in the village? An herbalist? Even a hedgewitch with a cluttered shelf?"

Tomren grunted. "Old Maren, near the chapel. She's eccentric, but she's the real thing."

"Real is all I need."

Sera rolled up the map with decisive movements, the parchment crinkling loudly in the quiet. "Then we return to Millhaven. Maintain operational security. Get you supplied. Then we move on Thornhollow." She met their eyes, her gaze steady now, resolved. "We have three to four hours before nightfall. That's our window."

"And the cultists?" Theron asked. "The ones who saw us leave?"

"They're reporting back to the witch," Tomren said grimly. "She already knows we're coming."

"Good." Sera's smile was sharp and cold. "Let her prepare. Let her worry. We're coming anyway."

---

## The Return

Theron looked back toward the direction of Millhaven, hidden beyond the trees.

"Those cultists who saw us—they'll report back to the witch. She'll know we're coming."

"Let her know," Sera said, rolling up the map with sharp, decisive movements. "We're not hiding anymore."

"But we don't go in blind." Tomren checked his crossbow, fingers moving through familiar motions. *Click-click-click* went the tension mechanism as he made minute adjustments. A low hum started in his throat—barely audible, a thinking sound. "We get supplies, components. A proper meal first."

Theron nodded. "There's an apothecary in Millhaven—Maren's. I'll need spell components if I'm going to be any use in there. And a focus, if she has one."

"We go back together," Sera said firmly. "Get what we need, rally at The Drowned Crow for final prep." Her hand moved to the locket at her throat. "Then we move on Thornhollow at nightfall."

The plan settled between them—not perfect, but *real*. Achievable.

"Watch for cultists in the village." Tomren positioned himself slightly behind Sera's left shoulder—the familiar place, her blind side covered.

"Then we deal with them if we have to." Sera's expression was hard. "We're not delaying because of a few hired knives. The clock is running, and Elina doesn't have time for us to be cautious."

---

*They moved through the forest with purpose now, looping wide around Millhaven's eastern approach. The village came into view through the trees—quiet, unaware of the storm gathering.*

*First, the apothecary. Then the tavern. Then Thornhollow.*

---

# Chapter 5: The Apothecary

**Maren's Apothecary** stood crooked beside the chapel, as if leaning away from the holy ground. The sign above the door was hand-painted and faded: *"Maren's Remedies & Rarities — No Refunds."*

The smell hit him before he crossed the threshold: dried herbs—thyme and sage, sharp and earthy—sulfur, something floral and sweet like roses, something *rotten* underneath it all, decay and death. The combination made his eyes water. Bundles of plants hung from every rafter, brushing his head as he entered, dried leaves crumbling at the touch. Shelves sagged under the weight of jars, vials, bones, feathers, stones—all labeled in faded ink. Dust motes swirled in the dim light filtering through grimy windows. A stuffed owl watched him from a high perch, glass eyes glinting with an unsettling awareness.

Behind the counter sat a woman who might be sixty or might be six hundred. Her hair was white and wild, escaping from what had once been a practical bun. She wore the simple, sturdy clothing of someone who worked with their hands—linen shirt worn soft with age, leather apron stained with decades of plant matter and alchemical experiments, the leather cracked and supple. Her fingers, moving with practiced efficiency as she ground something in a mortar—the rhythmic scrape of stone on stone filling the shop—were stained green and brown with herb residue and ink, the lines of her hands dark with it. She smelled of rosemary and earth. She didn't look up, but her eyes—when they briefly flicked toward him—were sharp and knowing, the color of rain-soaked stone, missing nothing.

"You smell like river water and witch-curse," she said. "Also desperation. What do you need?"

---

Theron scanned the cluttered shelves, mind racing through possibilities. His thumb found his index finger, beginning the familiar slide—index to middle to ring to pinky—as he calculated.

"Charcoal and herbs. Phosphorescent moss. A pouch of salt." He pointed to each in turn. "And I need a focus. Preferably two."

Maren's eyebrow rose—a gesture that involved her entire weathered face.

"Two foci? Ambitious." She set down her mortar and began gathering his selections with surprising speed. "Most wizards I've known barely manage one without setting themselves on fire."

"Most wizards you've known weren't assaulting Thornhollow Castle tonight."

Her hands paused. Just for a moment. Then she continued, her voice carefully neutral.

"Thornhollow, is it." Not a question. "Well. That explained the desperation."

---

She laid out his components on the counter:

- **Charcoal & herbs** — 1 silver
- **Phosphorescent moss** — 2 copper
- **Salt (pouch)** — 2 copper

*Running total: 1 silver, 4 copper*

Then she reached beneath the counter and produced the gnarled oak wand—twisted, rough-hewn, the wood still bearing bark in places—but humming faintly when his fingers brushed it. The vibration traveled up his arm, warm and alive.

"Two silver for this. It's ugly, but it'll channel clean." Her voice was rough, like grinding stone.

*That would leave him with 4 copper. Not enough for the pendant.*

Theron's fingers absently checked his component pouch—empty except for what he'd just purchased. The gesture was automatic, a reflex from years of inventory management. His thumb resumed its slide across his fingers.

Maren watched him calculate. A slow smile crept across her face.

"You're short."

"I'm aware."

She drummed her stained fingers on the counter, the wood hollow beneath her touch. Then, without warning, she reached up to a high shelf—her joints creaking audibly—and retrieved the cracked crystal pendant. It caught the dim light, refracting it into pale rainbows across the cluttered walls, dancing across jars and bones.

"Tell you what, wizard."

She set the pendant beside the wand.

"I'll give you both foci—wand *and* pendant—for two silver total. Call it a discount."

Theron narrowed his eyes. "What's the catch?"

"No catch. Just... *investment*." Her sharp gaze pinned him in place. "That witch has been a shadow over this valley for longer than you've been alive. Longer than *I've* been alive, and I've been alive a *very* long time."

She was silent for a long moment, stained fingers tracing the edge of the cracked pendant, the crystal smooth beneath her touch. Then she spoke, voice rougher than before, thick with something held back for too long.

"Her name was Lily." The words came slow, like pulling splinters. Her jaw worked. "My little sister. Thirty years younger than me—my mother's late-life surprise." A ghost of a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "She had a gift for growing things. Could coax blooms from stones, practically. Wanted to be a healer."

Maren reached beneath the counter and pulled out a battered leather journal, its binding cracked and worn, edges soft from years of handling. She flipped it open to a page marked with pressed flowers—moonpetals, their petals still faintly luminescent even decades later, delicate as tissue paper against the yellowed page. The smell of old paper and dried flowers rose between them.

"Thirty years ago, she was nineteen. Bright. Curious. *Stubborn*." Maren's jaw tightened. "Heard about a patch of moonpetals growing in the deep woods near Thornhollow. They're rare—only bloom under the new moon, and they're powerful for healing salves. She wanted to make medicine for the valley, help people."

She looked up, and for the first time, Theron saw real pain in her weathered face. Her eyes were wet, though no tears fell.

"I told her not to go. Those woods belonged to the witch even then—everyone knew it, even if no one would *say* it. But Lily..." She shook her head, a strand of white hair falling loose. "She said the woods belonged to everyone. That knowledge shouldn't be hoarded behind fear. She had her mother's stubbornness and her father's courage, and not a lick of my caution." Her voice cracked on the last word.

Maren closed the journal with deliberate care, the leather binding creaking. Her hands trembled slightly.

"She left at dawn. Said she'd be back by sunset. Had her gathering basket, her knife, her map." A pause. "She never came back. I searched for three days. Found her basket, overturned. The moonpetals, scattered. Signs of a struggle. And then... *nothing*."

Theron's thumb moved slowly across his fingers—index to middle to ring to pinky. The rhythm unconscious, processing grief he recognized too well.

Her fingers drummed the counter, sharp and rhythmic.

"Within a month, the village forgot her. Not gradually—*suddenly*. People I'd known all my life, people who'd known Lily since she was a baby, looked at me with blank faces when I said her name. Her friends couldn't remember her. The *priest* couldn't find her in the records." Her voice sharpened like a blade. "Szeth-Kaan's work. Even then, the demon was feeding, erasing her from memory to sustain itself."

"But you remember." Theron's observation was quiet, precise—identifying the crucial variable in her equation. His thumb traced the pattern again—index to pinky, a meditation on memory and loss.

"Because I write *everything* down." She tapped the journal. "Every name. Every face. Every person the witch has taken. I started the day after Lily vanished—wrote down everything I could remember about her. And I've been writing ever since. Thirty years of names the world forgot."

She opened the journal again, the pages crackling softly, and Theron saw page after page of careful handwriting—ink faded on some pages, fresh on others. Names. Dates. Brief descriptions. *Johan, miller's son, age 24. Disappeared autumn equinox. Sarah, tinker, age 31. Last seen near Thornhollow road.* Each entry precise, loving, remembered.

Dozens of names. Maybe hundreds. The weight of thirty years of grief, pressed between pages.

"This valley has bled for generations," Maren said. "And everyone forgets. The demon makes sure of it. But *I* remember. I keep the records. I tend the herbs. And I wait."

"Let me ask—why didn't you go after her yourself?" Theron's voice was careful, scholarly. "After the witch, I mean?"

Maren's laugh was bitter. "You think I didn't want to? I was forty-nine years old, wizard. I knew herbs and potions, not battle magic. I had no training with weapons, no allies who believed me, and every attempt to organize resistance..." She gestured vaguely. "People forget. Or they refuse to believe. Or they're too afraid. The witch has built her power on isolation—no one fights what they can't remember, and no one remembers what they never knew threatened them."

She leaned forward, both hands flat on the counter, the wood creaking under the pressure. Her face was close enough that he could see every line, every weathered crease carved by three decades of grief.

"I've spent thirty years keeping records. Helping travelers when they pass through. Supplying hedge wizards and witch hunters and foolish heroes who think *they'll* be different." Her eyes bored into him, fierce and desperate. "Most never come back. The ones who do... usually run. Leave the valley. Try to forget." Her breath smelled of mint tea and bitter herbs.

"And you blame them for that?" Theron asked, his tone precise, analytical. "For choosing survival?"

"No." The word was tired. "I understand. Survival is... survival. But it doesn't bring Lily back. Doesn't avenge the others. Doesn't stop the witch from taking *more*." She pushed the pendant and wand toward him. "So when someone like you shows up—someone who's already been inside, who's escaped, who has *fire* in their eyes instead of just fear—I invest."

"You're using me as a weapon." Theron's observation was measured, analytical—no judgment in the words. Simply identifying the pattern. "An investment in retribution."

"Yes." She didn't flinch from it. "But I think you're using yourself as one too. We both want the same thing. The witch ended. The demon banished. The bleeding *stopped*." Her voice dropped. "If you die in there, at least you'll die for something. And if you succeed..."

For the first time, something almost like hope flickered across her face. Her eyes brightened, the wet sheen catching light.

"If you succeed, maybe I can finally stop writing names in this damned book." Her voice broke, just slightly.

Her hand rested on the journal like a benediction over graves, fingers spread across the worn leather as if she could feel every name pressed into the pages beneath.

"So you take these." She tapped the pendant and wand. "You burn that castle to the ground. And if you meet whatever's wearing my sister's bones..."

She didn't finish.

She didn't need to.

---

*Theron nodded slowly.*

"I'll do what I can. Though I should clarify—" His fingers tapped the counter. "What I can do may not align with what needs to be done."

"Do more than you can." Maren's hands paused in their wrapping. "That's what heroes are for."

She looked at him for a long moment, really *looked*—at the exhaustion in his face, the determination in his eyes, the way he held himself like someone who'd already accepted he might not come back.

"You've lost someone too," she said. Not a question.

"My son. Eight years ago. Let me think..." His fingers checked the empty component pouch again—a hollow gesture, like reaching for something that would never be there. "Eight years, two months, sixteen days." The precision was armor. Under his breath, barely audible: *"Lux... perpetua..."* Fragment of a spell he'd never finished casting. Fragment of a prayer no god had answered.

Something shifted in her expression. Understanding. Shared grief creating a bridge between two strangers. Her shoulders dropped, the defensive hardness easing.

"Then you know." She finished wrapping the components with careful precision, her movements gentler now. The paper crinkled beneath her fingers. "What it's like. The not knowing. The wondering if there was something you could have done differently. The way the world keeps turning while you're still stuck in the moment they vanished." Her voice was soft, almost tender.

"Every day." Theron's voice was quiet, precise. "The variables change—weather, location, circumstance—but the equation remains unsolved. Every day." His thumb moved again—index to middle to ring to pinky—the slow slide of counting losses, measuring grief in familiar gestures.

Maren nodded once, sharp and final. She placed the wrapped bundle in his hands, the package warm from her touch, the paper rough beneath his fingers.

"Then make it *mean* something. Your pain. My pain. Lily's death. Your son's disappearance. All of it." Her weathered face was fierce, eyes blazing. "Make the witch pay for every name in this book. For every family like yours and mine."

Theron's hand closed around the component pouch, feeling the weight of what he carried now—not just components, but thirty years of grief, eight years of searching, countless lives lost. His thumb traced the familiar pattern one more time—a promise sealed in gesture.

She pulled out a scrap of paper, wrote something quickly, and tucked it into his component pouch.

"That's my name and this shop's location. If you survive..." She paused, as if surprised by her own words. "If you survive and you actually manage to end this nightmare, come find me. There'll be work to do. Helping the survivors, undoing the damage, making sure people *remember* properly."

"And if I don't survive?" Theron asked. A hypothesis that required testing. "What then?"

"Then I'll add your name to the book." She said it without cruelty. Just fact. "Theron Ashborne, wizard, died trying to end the Witch of Thornhollow. And I'll remember you. Like I remember all the others."

It should be morbid. Grim. But somehow, coming from her, it felt like a promise. Like insurance that even if he failed, someone would know he'd *tried*. His thumb moved across his fingers one last time, a benediction over his own potential grave.

"Thank you." Theron's words were measured, deliberate. He meant them with the full weight of academic precision—gratitude as certainty, not sentiment.

"Don't thank me yet." But her eyes were almost warm. "Save it for when you come back."

But Maren didn't say it. And neither did he.

---

Theron pocketed the components, feeling their weight settle against his hip, reassuring and real. He hung the pendant around his neck, the chain cold against his skin. The crystal rested against his chest, cool and faintly pulsing—like a second heartbeat, slightly out of sync with his own. He could feel the magic in it, unstable but powerful, humming against his sternum.

The wand fit his grip as if carved for it, the rough wood warm against his palm, grooves and bark pressing into his skin. Not elegant. Not pretty. But *ready*.

Whisper emerged from his hood, eyeing the pendant.

"Cracked crystal. Unstable resonance." He sniffed. "You're going to do something reckless with that, aren't you?"

"Probably."

"Good. I'd hate to have chosen a *boring* wizard."

---

Maren watched him turn toward the door.

"One more thing."

Theron paused.

She held out a small leather pouch, no larger than his thumb.

"Powdered iron. On the house." Her eyes glittered. "For the wards. You'll need it."

**The Tavern Awaits**

Theron stepped out of Maren's shop, the new components secure in his pouch, the wand at his belt feeling right in a way he hadn't felt in days. The pendant hung cool against his chest, pulsing faintly with residual magic.

Whisper emerged from his hood, sniffing the evening air.

"The Drowned Crow is three streets over. Sera and Tomren should be there by now."

"One last meal." Theron's murmur carried the weight of ritual, of preparation. "Before we walk into the dark. Do you know if they serve anything substantive, or should I expect battlefield rations disguised as stew?"

"Technically, you've already walked into the dark once," Whisper pointed out. "This would be the second time. Which makes it a pattern, not an adventure."

"Encouraging."

"I do what I can."

The rain was beginning—light drops at first, cold against his face, but with the promise of more to come. The smell of wet stone and approaching storm filled the air. The storm that would mask their assault was building. Thunder rumbled in the distance, low and ominous.

Theron pulled his hood up, the fabric rough against his ears, and headed toward the tavern. His boots splashed through forming puddles. Toward his companions. Toward whatever came next.

---

# Chapter 6: Before the Storm

## The Drowned Crow

The tavern was quieter than before. Fewer patrons, more shadows. The afternoon light filtering through the shutters had taken on that golden, heavy quality that came before storms. The air smelled of woodsmoke and simmering stew, warm and comforting. The barkeep—the same flour-dusted woman from Theron's first visit—looked up as he entered, then gave a subtle nod toward the back corner.

The same table where he'd first met Sera and Tomren sat empty, waiting. The wood was scarred and worn smooth by countless hands. Theron made his way over and took a seat with his back to the wall, positioned to watch the door. The bench creaked beneath him.

The barkeep approached without being asked, setting down bread, cheese, and cold meat on a wooden platter. The bread was still warm from the oven, steam rising faintly. She leaned in close enough that he could smell flour and yeast on her apron, voice low.

"Those two you left in the square?" A pause. "Gone. Some folk helped them... leave. Quickly."

She squeezed his shoulder once—brief, careful, her hand warm through his robe—then returned to her bar without another word, her footsteps soft on the worn floorboards.

---

Theron reached for the bread, tearing off a piece while he waited for the others. His left thumb rubbed across his fingertips—index, middle, ring, pinky—a thinking habit he'd never quite broken. The food was simple but warm—exactly what they needed.

Whisper emerged from Theron's hood, whiskers twitching as he surveyed the table. His small nose pointed decisively toward the cheese wedge on the communal platter.

"Is that...?"

"Aged cheddar, I think." Theron broke off a generous piece and placed it on a small wooden plate, sliding it in front of the familiar. "You've earned it."

Whisper approached it with uncharacteristic reverence.

"You didn't have to do this."

"You saved my life. Multiple times. In the span of one night."

"That's... fair." He sniffed the cheese, whiskers trembling. "This is *real* cheese. Not tavern scrapings. Not moldy rind."

"Consider it a down payment. For everything that comes next."

---

The familiar took a small, deliberate bite. His eyes closed.

For a moment, he was not an ancient creature bound by centuries of magical servitude. He was just a small animal enjoying something good.

"You know," Whisper said quietly, "she never fed me. The witch. Not once in forty years. I had to scavenge. Hunt. Steal." He took another bite. "She saw me as a tool. An extension of her will. Not a... partner."

Theron said nothing. He just pushed the plate a little closer.

Whisper ate in silence. So did he.

---

The door opened.

**Tomren** entered first, a heavy pack slung over one shoulder, his crossbow freshly oiled. He nodded at him and claimed a chair, setting the pack down with a solid *thunk*. Without seeming to think about it, he positioned himself at Sera's back, angled toward the door.

"Weapons are ready. Thirty bolts. Four alchemical flasks—two smoke, two fire. Rope. Grappling hook." He paused. "Also bandages. Lots of bandages."

"Optimistic."

"Realistic."

---

**Sera** arrived minutes later, her expression grim.

"The elder didn't believe me. Not fully." She dropped into a seat, rubbing her temples. "I told him Thornhollow was active, that something was coming. He agreed to send runners to the neighboring villages, to *consider* an evacuation. But these people have lived in this valley for generations. They don't flee easily."

"What happens when Szeth-Kaan comes?" Theron asked carefully.

"They won't remember to flee." Her voice was bitter. "That's the problem."

She looked at his new acquisitions—the wand, the pendant, the pouches at his belt.

"Operational parameters. You found what you needed?"

"Enough to make a difference. Maybe." His fingers brushed the empty component pouch at his belt—the one stripped clean by the witch. A reflexive gesture seeking reassurance that wasn't there.

"Maybe is better than nothing." She pulled out the map, now annotated with his earlier additions, her eyes automatically sweeping the room—two exits, three windows, four other patrons. "Let's go over this one more time. Entry points, objectives, contingencies."

---

*The afternoon unfolded in planning.*

**Entry:** The drainage tunnels. He knew the way, and the broken grate remained open.

**Primary objectives:**
1. **Locate Elina** — likely in the dungeons or kept near the ritual chamber
2. **Recover his spellbook and components** — the study, upper level
3. **Disrupt or banish Szeth-Kaan** — the ritual chamber, if possible

**Contingencies:**
- If separated, regroup at the drainage grate
- If overwhelmed, *retreat*—live to fight another day
- If the witch is encountered directly... improvise

"I don't like that last contingency," Tomren muttered. *Click-click-click*—his fingers adjusted the crossbow's tension mechanism, a nervous habit.

"Neither do I," Sera admits. "But we don't know what she's capable of now. Not with that thing bound to her."

She rolled up the map with deliberate care, then looked at each of them in turn.

"We eat. Rest while we can. Storm reaches Thornhollow at 2100 hours. We move at 2030."

---

**The Wait**

Marta brought food without being asked—more stew, fresh bread, a platter of roasted vegetables, and a pitcher of watered wine. She set it down, met Sera's eyes for a moment, and nodded once.

They ate in silence at first. The weight of the coming night sat heavy on the table between them.

Theron found himself studying his companions. Really looking at them for the first time since they fled the village together.

**Sera** — mid-thirties, maybe. The scar on her face was old, from some battle before this one. Her hands, wrapped around her cup, bore calluses from years of sword work. But when she thought no one was watching, her fingers traced the outline of the locket hidden beneath her tunic. Over and over. *Elina. Elina. Elina.*

**Tomren** — older, perhaps forty. Broad-shouldered, steady, with the kind of quiet competence that came from surviving when others didn't. He sat perfectly still, listening to the tavern sounds around them with the focus of a hunter. His eyes kept drifting to Sera. Checking. Making sure she was still there.

"Tell me about her," Theron said quietly.

Sera looked up from her cup. "What?"

"Elina." He paused, choosing his words. "Not the tactical details. Not what the witch might have done. Tell me about *her*. Let me understand who we're fighting for."

Sera's jaw tightened. Her fingers went white-knuckled around her cup, the wood creaking faintly under the pressure. For a moment, he thought she would refuse. The fire crackled in the silence between them.

Then something in her expression softened, the hard lines around her eyes easing.

---

**Elina**

"She was—*is*—" Sera corrected herself fiercely. "She is sixteen. Almost seventeen now." She took a breath. "Smart. Too smart, sometimes. Questions everything. Drove her tutors mad."

A ghost of a smile touched her lips.

"When she was seven, she convinced the village priest that his theology was flawed. Had him second-guessing scripture for *weeks*." Sera shakes her head. "She's always been like that. Curious. Fearless. Thought she could argue her way out of anything."

"Sounds dangerous," Whisper observes from the table.

"She is." Sera's voice is fond despite the fear underneath. "She wanted to be a scholar. Study at one of the academies. She'd save her coin from helping at the market, planning to pay for her own tuition."

Her hand went to her throat, fingers finding the locket chain. The metal was warm from her skin. She pulled it out with trembling fingers, opening it to show the painted portrait. The young woman inside had Sera's sharp features but softer. Younger. Her eyes were bright with intelligence and mischief.

"She used to sing," Sera said quietly, thumb tracing the edge of the portrait. "Badly. Absolutely *terribly*. But she'd sing anyway while doing chores, making up ridiculous lyrics." A pause. Her voice grew thick. "The house has been so quiet since—"

Her voice broke. She pressed her lips together, jaw working as she fought for control. A tear tracked down her scarred cheek despite her efforts.

Tomren's hand found her shoulder, squeezed once. His grip was steady, grounding.

"We'll get her back," he said firmly. "A week from now, you'll be complaining about her singing again."

Sera laughed—a wet, broken sound that was half sob. She wiped her face with the heel of her hand, rough and impatient with her own tears. "Gods, I hope so."

---

**Why Tomren Stays**

Theron looked at Tomren. "You didn't have to come. This isn't your fight."

Tomren took a long drink from his cup. Set it down. Went very still, the kind of stillness that came before difficult truths.

"Sera saved my life three years back at Kren's Crossing. Took an arrow through the lung during the battle—nearly drowned in my own blood."

He traced a scar on his neck, barely visible above his collar.

"Two miles to the nearest surgeon. Sera carried me the whole way, then stayed three days while I recovered." He looked at Sera. "She didn't know me, didn't owe me anything. But she stayed anyway."

Sera shifted uncomfortably. "You would've done the same."

"Maybe. But you did." Tomren's expression was unreadable. "So when you came to me six months ago asking for help with this nightmare—witch, castle, your daughter taken—there was only one answer I could give."

"You could've said no," Theron pointed out.

"Could've. Didn't." Tomren's fingers found his crossbow, adjusting the tension with small, precise movements. *Click-click-click*. "I'm tired of running from things like this. Someone has to stand against the monsters. Might as well be us."

---

**Theron's Search**

Sera turned to Theron. "What about you? You said you came looking for your son. But you haven't told us much else."

"Lucian," he said. The name still hurt, like pressing on a bruise that never healed. "My son. Twenty-two when he vanished. Eight years ago now."

He stared into his cup, watching the wine ripple with the tremor in his hands. The liquid was dark red, the color of blood in firelight.

"He was brilliant. Curious. Always chasing the next question, the next mystery." A bitter smile twisted his lips. "I taught him magic. Theory, technique, control. Thought I'd prepared him for anything." His throat felt tight. He had to force the words out.

What happened?

"He heard rumors. A witch in these parts who could speak to ancient powers, bridge worlds, access knowledge lost to modern practitioners." Theron's hands tightened on the cup. "I told him they were just stories. But Lucian was... persistent. He found books, translated old texts, followed leads I didn't even know existed."

"And then he left," Sera said. Understanding in her voice.

"One morning, just... gone. Left a note saying he'd be back in a few weeks. That was eight years ago." He took a breath, but it caught in his chest. Eight years of searching. Eight years of not knowing. "I searched. Villages, academies, hedge wizards, anyone who might have seen him. Found a pattern—young practitioners vanishing near Thornhollow. All chasing the same rumors." His hands curled into fists on the table.

"You think he found her," Tomren said.

"I think he came here. I found one of his books—margins full of notes in his handwriting. All pointing to Thornhollow, to 'the witch who bridges worlds.'" Theron met their eyes. "Let me be clear. I don't know if he made it to the castle. Don't know if she has him, killed him, or if he died along the way. But she's my only lead. My only chance at answers."

The weight of eight years sat heavy between them, thick as smoke in the warm tavern air. Outside, the first drops of rain began to tap against the shutters.

"That's why you need her alive," Sera said quietly, understanding in her voice. "Not just to stop her. To know."

"To know." The words tasted like ash in his mouth. "Even if the answer is the worst one... I need to know. I've been searching for eight years. I can't stop now. Not when I'm this close." His voice cracked on the last word. He stared at his hands, at the burn scars that marked him as a wizard.

"That's not your fault," Sera said. "Young people chase dangerous things. We can't lock them away."

"Can't I?" The bitterness surprised him. "I knew he was curious. Knew he was fascinated by dangerous magic. I could have forbidden him, hidden the books, *something*—"

"He would've left anyway," Tomren cut in. "Just would've been angrier about it and less prepared for what he found." He shook his head. "Young people make their own choices. We can't stop that."

Sera's voice was soft. "I've spent six months blaming myself for Elina's capture. Thinking of everything I should've done differently. But the truth is—" She stopped. Swallowed. "The truth is, the witch took her. *She* did this. Not me. Not you. Her."

Theron wanted to believe that. Wanted to stop carrying the weight of Lucian's disappearance like a stone in his chest.

"When we get inside," he said quietly, "when we find the witch... if she knows something about what happened to him—"

"You'll get your answers," Sera promised. "Priority one, before extraction. I know what it's like, not knowing."

"Justice or revenge?" Tomren asked quietly.

"Does it matter?"

"Might," Tomren said. "When the moment comes."

Theron thought about that. About Lucian's face the last time he saw him—excited, eager, so sure he could handle whatever he found.

"Let me think..." A long pause. "I'll face that when I have to." Under his breath, barely audible: "*Ignis... fortis... vinculum...*" Fragments of incantations, spoken like prayers.

---

**The Oath**

The rain picked up outside, drumming steadily against the shutters, a low rhythmic beat. The fire crackled, sending sparks up the chimney, bathing the room in warm orange light. The tavern was empty except for them and Marta, who was pretending not to listen from behind the bar, her polishing cloth moving in slow, distracted circles over the same tankard.

Sera pushed her empty plate aside and leaned forward, elbows on the table. She rolled her shoulders once, twice—loosening them, preparing.

"Assess the situation." Her voice was blunt. "We might not survive this. The witch has magic, thralls, that... thing bound to her. We're three people, a rat, and desperation."

"Your recruitment speech needs work," Whisper observed.

Sera ignored him. "But if we do this—if we actually pull this off—we save Elina. We stop whatever the witch is planning. We maybe prevent an entire village from being erased from existence." She looked at each of them. "And if we don't make it out... at least we died doing something that *mattered*."

"Inspiring," Tomren deadpanned. But his expression was serious.

Theron thought about Lucian. About the oubliette on the fourth level, and all those forgotten dead. About what he might find when they go back inside.

"I'm in," he said. "All the way. Whatever it takes."

"Agreed."

Sera pulled out her sword—just an inch, the steel whispering against the scabbard, enough for the blade to catch the firelight and gleam gold and red—and laid her hand on the exposed steel.

"An old soldier's oath," she said, voice steady and ceremonial. "From my garrison days." She looked at them expectantly.

Theron placed his hand on the blade. The metal was cool against his palm, smooth and unyielding. He could feel his pulse against the steel. Tomren added his, his calloused hand settling beside theirs with quiet certainty. Three hands, three lives, touching the same steel.

Sera spoke, her voice steady:

"*By steel and blood, by choice and will,*
*We stand together, come what may.*
*If I fall, you carry on.*
*If you fall, I do not forget.*
*Until the task is done, or we are.*"

She looked at Theron. He repeated the words. Then Tomren, his gruff voice surprisingly gentle.

When they finished, Sera sheathed the blade with a solid *click* of finality. The sound seemed louder than it should be in the quiet tavern.

"There," she said. "Now it's official. We're not just allies. We're *bound*." The firelight caught her eyes, making them shine.

Whisper climbed onto Theron's shoulder. "And what about me? Do I not get to make dramatic pronouncements?"

"You already made your choice," Theron said. "Back in the cell, when you helped me escape."

"True." The rat's whiskers twitch. "Though I reserve the right to reconsider if things get *too* suicidal."

"Fair enough."

---

*Evening fell properly now. The storm arrived with it—rain lashing the windows in sheets, thunder rolling across the valley like drums of war. The temperature dropped, making the fire's warmth more precious.*

---

**Final Preparations**

They moved to their gear in comfortable silence now. The oath had changed something. The air felt different—charged, purposeful.

Tomren distributed the alchemical flasks, showing Theron how the smoke bombs worked ("Pull the pin, throw it, then run."), and Sera took two of the fire flasks, securing them to her belt with practiced efficiency.

Sera checked everyone's armor and weapons with a soldier's thoroughness. She adjusted a strap on Tomren's pack, tightened a buckle on Theron's component pouch.

"Contingency," she said, still focused on the buckle. "If you have to choose between the spellbook and Elina—"

"Elina," Theron said immediately. "Every time."

She looked up, meeting his eyes. Something passed between them. Understanding. Trust.

"Good answer."

---

Whisper surveyed the group from the table, tail twitching.

"You know," he said conversationally, "in forty years of service, I've seen the witch face down challengers before. Wizards. Witch hunters. A paladin once, all shining armor and righteous fury."

"Encouraging," Tomren muttered.

"She killed them all," Whisper continued. "Brutally. Efficiently. Without mercy."

Point?

"The point," Whisper said, "is that none of them had what you have."

"Which is?"

The rat's whiskers twitched. "Something to lose. The paladin fought for duty. The wizards fought for pride. The hunters fought for gold." He looked at each of them. "You three are fighting for something *irreplaceable*. That makes you dangerous in ways she won't expect."

He climbed onto Theron's shoulder, settling into place.

"Also, you have me. Which helps considerably."

Despite everything, Theron smiled.

---

Marta approached their table, wiping her hands on her apron, the fabric worn soft from years of use. She set down a wrapped bundle—the oilcloth crinkling softly.

"Bread, cheese, dried meat," she said gruffly, not quite meeting their eyes. "In case you make it out and need something to eat before you can get back here."

Sera took the bundle, the weight of it solid and real in her hands. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just..." Marta's expression was fierce, jaw tight. "Just come back. All of you. We've lost enough people to that place." Her voice cracked on the last word.

She turned away quickly, but not before Theron saw the moisture in her eyes, the way her shoulders shook.

---

**The Walk to Thornhollow**

Sera stood, her hand automatically adjusting her sword belt, checking the position. The blade sat perfectly at her hip, balanced and ready.

"2030 hours. Time to move."

Tomren shouldered his pack, the weight settling familiar across his back. His crossbow was already loaded, a bolt locked in place. Thirty more waited in his quiver.

Theron touched the wand at his belt. The pendant pulsed against his chest—warm, steady, alive with borrowed power. His component pouch sat heavy but reassuring.

*No. He was not ready. But when had that ever stopped him?*

"Let's go get your daughter," he said to Sera.

She nodded, jaw set with determination. "Adapt. We end a witch."

"And banish an ancient horror from beyond the stars," Whisper added cheerfully. "Don't forget that part."

"Couldn't if we tried."

---

They stepped out into the storm together.

The rain hit immediately—cold needles against exposed skin, soaking through fabric in seconds. The wind whipped at them, carrying the smell of wet earth and distant lightning. Thunder rolled across the valley like a warning, felt as much as heard, vibrating in their chests. Lightning illuminated the distant silhouette of Thornhollow Castle, perched on its hill like a predator waiting, all sharp angles and malevolent towers against the roiling sky. Then darkness again.

But Theron didn't walk alone anymore.

Sera moved to his left, sword hand ready, her boots splashing through puddles forming on the road. Tomren took position on his right, crossbow up, scanning the darkness, rain streaming off the brim of his hood. Whisper clung to his shoulder, tiny claws digging in through wet fabric, warm despite the rain, breath tickling his neck.

*This was it. No more planning. No more preparation. Just the long walk through the storm, toward the castle, toward answers, toward an ending.*

*One way or another.*

---

The road to Thornhollow awaited.

---

# Chapter 7: Into the Dark

*The rain was relentless.*

It hammered down in sheets, cold needles against their faces, turning the road to sucking mud that pulled at their boots with every step. The water soaked through robes within minutes—first the shoulders, then seeping down the back, the chest, until the fabric clung cold and heavy, chafing with every movement. Theron's hair was plastered to his forehead, water running into his eyes, down his neck in icy rivulets. But there was a strange comfort in it—the storm masked their approach, drowned their footsteps with its constant roar, blinded any watchers the witch might have posted.

Sera led the way, moving with a soldier's efficiency despite the mud sucking at her boots, each step making soft squelching sounds. Tomren brought up the rear, crossbow wrapped in oilcloth, eyes scanning the treeline through the rain-blurred darkness. Theron walked between them, one hand on his wand—the wood slick beneath his wet palm—the other shielding his face from the downpour. His legs ached from fighting the mud. His fingers were going numb.

Whisper had retreated deep into his hood, a small warm presence against his neck, fur damp despite the shelter.

"I hate rain," the familiar mutters.

"You're a rat. I thought rats liked sewers."

"That's a vicious stereotype."

---

**Two Hours Later — The Edge of Thornhollow Forest**

The trees rose before them like a wall of shadows, branches clawing at the stormy sky. Even in daylight, this forest would feel wrong—the branches twisted at unnatural angles, bark ridged and cracked like diseased skin, the undergrowth grew thick and grasping, thorns catching at their clothes. And there was a *smell* beneath the rain. Decay—not the clean rot of autumn leaves, but something putrid, like week-old meat left in the sun. Old magic, sharp and metallic on the tongue, making teeth ache. Something watching.

The temperature dropped as they approached. Not gradually—*sharply*. As if stepping across an invisible threshold into winter. One moment, rain-soaked and miserable. The next, *freezing*, the cold biting through wet clothes like knives. Theron's breath misted in white clouds. His wet fingers went numb around his wand, joints stiffening, the skin turning pale. His damp robes felt like ice pressed against his skin.

"Do you feel that?" he whispered. "The temperature drop—it's too sharp to be natural."

"Unnatural cold. Something's changed the air itself," Tomren said, voice low and steady.

"Dark magic," Whisper corrected from the hood. "Centuries of it, seeping into the land like poison into groundwater. The forest has been *changed*. It remembers every soul she's taken here."

Sera held up a fist. They stopped.

"Lost our first scout here," she said quietly, rain streaming down her scarred face. "Thirty paces in. Found the body seven days later, two miles out. No wounds. No marks." She paused. "No eyes."

"That's a grim find," Tomren said, his jaw tight.

"The forest itself isn't the danger," Whisper said from his hood. "It's her *awareness*. The trees, the animals, the shadows—they report to her. We need to move quickly and quietly."

Theron peered into the darkness between the trunks. His left thumb moved unconsciously across his fingertips—index, middle, ring, pinky—calculating risks, planning routes.

"Can you guide us around her watchpoints? Or are they too densely distributed?"

"Some of them. Not all." The familiar's voice is grim. "She's had centuries to weave her web. But there are... dead zones. Places where her attention doesn't reach. Old shrines. Cursed ground. Areas she's learned to avoid."

Sera exchanges a glance with Tomren. Her eyes swept the treeline—counting shadows, assessing angles, automatic as breathing. She rolled her shoulders once, a fighter's preparation.

"We follow the rat's lead, then."

---

The darkness under the canopy is absolute, pressing against their eyes like a physical weight. Rain and storm clouds have stolen what little daylight remained. The forest floor squelched beneath their boots, mud and rotting leaves releasing the smell of decomposition with every step. Water dripped from branches overhead, cold drops hitting necks and faces without warning.

Theron pulled the phosphorescent moss from his component pouch—Maren's gift. He crushed a small amount between his numb fingers, the moss releasing a faint earthy smell as it began to glow with a pale greenish light. The luminescence pulsed faintly, like a slow heartbeat. Not bright enough to carry far, but enough to see the twisted roots and dark hollows beneath their feet.

"Smart thinking," Sera whispered, watching the pale illumination. "Risk of detection?"

"Natural light," Whisper confirmed. "The forest is full of it. Her watchers won't notice one more patch of glowing fungus."

---

Whisper guided them through the forest like a thread through a needle. Left around the hollow oak—a raven nested there, one of hers. Right past the standing stones—she didn't look there anymore, not since something had driven her out decades ago. Straight through the stream, the water masking their scent.

Theron crushed more moss as needed, leaving faint glowing markers behind them—a trail back to safety, should they need it. His fingers found the component pouch at his belt, touching the silk bundle of Maren's gift with something like reverence.

Tomren's foot snaps a branch—the crack sharp and loud despite the rain, echoing through the unnatural silence.

They all freeze, hearts hammering, breath held.

*Silence. Rain pattering on leaves. Thunder rumbling in the distance.*

Then—movement in the canopy above. Something large, shifting between branches with a sound like leather scraping over wood. The sound of wings, leathery and wet, displacing air with heavy beats. A smell wafted down—carrion and sulfur, making Theron's stomach turn.

Theron's hand tightened on his wand, knuckles white, palm sweating despite the cold. He didn't look up. Looking up meant looking away from the path, losing his footing, making noise. His pulse thundered in his ears. Under his breath, barely audible over the pounding of his own heartbeat: "*Praesidium... tenebris...*" Half-formed incantation fragments, nervous energy seeking outlet.

The thing above them *screamed*—not a bird's cry, but something that sounded almost human. Almost. The sound vibrated through their chests, primal and wrong, making every instinct scream *run*.

Then it was gone, the sound of heavy wings fading into the storm, leaving only the smell of death behind.

"One of hers?" Sera breathed.

"One of many," Whisper confirmed, trembling. "Move. *Faster*."

---

**One Hour Later — The Ravine**

Theron emerged from the treeline onto familiar ground, boots sliding on wet stone at the ravine's edge. The ravine stretched before him, a dark gash in the earth, the river churning far below with the roar of swollen stormwater—white foam visible even in the darkness, the sound like continuous thunder. The spray reached up, misting their faces with icy droplets. And above, barely visible through the sheets of rain—

**Thornhollow Castle.**

It clung to the cliffside like a growth, like a cancer of stone, all twisted spires and dark stone that seemed to drink the light. Lightning illuminated it in brilliant flashes: a window here, reflecting white light like a dead eye; a battlement there, sharp against the storm; the great iron doors that he'd never enter through, studded and massive and forbidding.

But they weren't going in through the front. The air here tasted of stone and cold water and something else—the faint metallic tang of old blood, carried on the wind from the castle above.

"There." Theron pointed to the drainage grate—still broken, still hanging open. The river rushed past it, higher than before. "That's our entrance."

Sera studied the gap, fingers brushing the locket at her throat. "Water level's high. Half-flooded."

"It was dry when I escaped. The storm's filled it." Theron calculated, thumb moving across his fingertips again—measuring, weighing. "We'll be wading. Maybe swimming in places. But it's still passable."

"If it floods completely while we're inside?"

"Then we find another way out. Or we don't." He met her eyes. "This is the path I know. The path I *survived*."

She held his gaze for a long moment.

Then she nodded.

"Tomren. Get the rope ready."

---

**The Descent**

Tomren anchored the rope to a sturdy oak, testing it with his full weight—the hemp creaking but holding—and one by one, they descended into the ravine. The rocks were slick with rain, sharp edges hidden by moss and running water. More than once, Theron's foot slipped, his boot scraping against stone, hands burning as the rope slid through his palms before he caught himself. The muscles in his arms screamed. His shoulders ached. But the rope held, and his companions held, and somehow they *reached* the bottom without broken bones, landing in ankle-deep water that soaked immediately through his boots.

The river roared past, waist-high and *cold*—not the shocking cold of his first escape, but still brutal, stealing breath, making muscles cramp. The current tugged at their legs, hungry and strong. The drainage grate loomed ahead, a dark mouth in the cliff face, water pouring from it in a constant stream. Even from here, Theron could smell it—the rot, sweet and nauseating; the chemicals, sharp and acrid like burning copper; the wrongness that seeped from the castle's foundations. The smell made his eyes water.

This close to the castle, the air itself felt *heavy*. Oppressive. As if the stones above were watching, waiting, judging. The temperature had dropped again—colder than the forest, colder than should be possible. Their breath came in white clouds.

"Stay close to the walls," Theron shouted over the water. "Don't let the current take you. Maintain contact with the stone."

He entered first.

---

**The Drainage Tunnels**

The darkness swallowed them whole—complete, absolute, pressing against eyes and skin like a living thing.

Water surged around Theron's legs, thigh-deep and freezing, tugging at him with surprising strength. He pressed one hand against the slick stone wall, slime coating the surface, making his palm slide. Wand in the other hand, held high above the water. Behind him, Sera's breathing was steady, controlled despite the cold—he could hear the slight chattering of her teeth between breaths. Tomren cursed softly as he fought the current, the splash of his bulk displacing water echoing off close walls.

The smell down here was worse—not just rot, but *chemical*. Sharp and acrid, like burning copper mixed with sulfur, with something underneath that tasted bitter on the tongue. The residue of dark magic, washed down from whatever horrors happened in the castle above. The stench burned his nostrils, made his eyes water and his stomach heave. He breathed through his mouth, but that only made it worse—he could *taste* it.

"Whisper. Directions." His voice echoed strangely in the confined space.

"Straight for thirty paces. Then the first left—*don't* take the right, it's collapsed now. After that, up."

Theron pushed forward, step by step, muscles straining against the current. The water rose to his chest in places, so cold it made his ribs ache, made breathing difficult. The dark was absolute—he couldn't see his own hand in front of his face, could only feel the slimy wall beneath his palm, the icy water pulling at his robes. His foot touched something soft in the water—yielding, bloated, wrong—he didn't look down, didn't think about what it might be, just kept moving, skin crawling, trying not to imagine.

Then—a split in the tunnel.

"Left," Whisper confirmed.

Theron turned. The water was shallower here, only knee-deep. The tunnel began to slope upward. With each step, the chemical smell faded slightly, replaced by something else—old stone, torch smoke, and underneath it all, the faint metallic tang of blood.

"We're past the flood line now," Theron breathed. "Keep moving upward."

---

**Ten Minutes Later — The Lower Dungeons**

Theron emerged into a corridor he recognized, water streaming from his robes, forming puddles on the stone floor. Torchlight flickered on damp stone walls—the same enchanted flames that never died, casting dancing shadows. The cells lined both sides, iron bars rusted but solid, dark openings like mouths. The air here was warmer than the tunnels but still cold, still damp, smelling of mold and human waste and old fear.

His cell was there. Third on the left. The door still hung open, darkness beyond. Seeing it again made his chest tighten, memories flooding back—the cold, the hunger, the despair.

But they weren't alone.

**A thrall stood at the far end of the corridor.**

It had been human once. That was the worst part—the remnants of humanity still visible beneath what she'd done to it. It wore the tattered remains of a merchant's clothes, now filthy and torn, stained with things best not examined. Its skin had a gray pallor, like week-old corpse flesh, waxy and slack. The smell reached them even at this distance—rot and decay, the sweet-putrid stench of meat left too long. Its eyes...

Its eyes were *empty*. Not dead—worse than dead. *Hollowed out*. Whatever made this person a person was gone, consumed, leaving only the shell behind to serve. Looking into those eyes was like looking into an abyss.

The thrall swayed slightly, head tilted at an unnatural angle, as if listening to voices they couldn't hear. Its jaw hung slightly open, revealing teeth stained dark. It hadn't seen them yet, but its nostrils flared, sniffing the air.

Sera's hand moved to her sword, steel whispering against leather. Her eyes tracked the corridor—two exits, one alcove, no cover. Tomren silently raised his crossbow, bolt aimed center mass, and positioned himself at Sera's back without a word.

Whisper's claws dug into Theron's shoulder.

"There's another one," the familiar breathed. "Around the corner. I can smell it."

*Two thralls. One visible, one hidden.*

Theron's throat tightened. He'd read about thralls—victims of domination magic, their wills crushed, their souls trapped in their own bodies like prisoners. Some traditions said they were aware. Conscious. Screaming silently behind dead eyes while their bodies obeyed.

He didn't know if that was true.

He hoped it wasn't.

Theron reached for his component pouch, pulling out the charcoal and herbs Maren had given him. He whispered the incantation for *Find Familiar*—not to summon, but to *sense*. The magic rippled outward, searching for other bound creatures nearby.

*A spider in the corner. Two rats in the walls. All hers. All watching.*

But none were looking this direction. Yet.

"Her eyes are here," Theron breathed. "Multiple watchers—but none are looking this direction. We need to move immediately before they shift position."

---

## Sneaking Past

Theron held up a hand, stopping Sera mid-draw. She looked at him, questioning. He shook his head slowly and pointed to the branching corridor on his left—a narrow passage, half-hidden in shadow. His thumb traced the familiar pattern across his fingers: plan, adapt, survive.

"Around," he mouthed silently.

Sera's jaw tightened. Every instinct in her screamed to fight, to push forward, to find Elina *now*. But she was a soldier. She understood tactics.

She nodded.

---

They moved like ghosts, each step careful, breath held.

The side passage was tight—single file, shoulders brushing rough stone on both sides, the walls cold and damp. Water dripped from somewhere above, the sound echoing in the confined space, each drop loud in the silence. The torchlight didn't reach here; they navigated by touch—hands scraping against wet stone—by Whisper's whispered directions barely audible over their own breathing, by the faint phosphorescent glow of moss clinging to the ceiling like diseased stars. The air was stale, thick with the smell of mold and something older, earthier—grave dirt.

Theron's foot caught on something. He looked down, the faint moss-light just enough to see—

A child's shoe. Small, leather, well-worn with age and use. The laces still tied in a careful bow. Lying discarded against the wall like refuse, half-buried in dust and debris.

His stomach turned, bile rising in his throat. He didn't stop moving—couldn't afford to—but the image burned into his mind, searing itself behind his eyes. Someone's child had worn that shoe. Walked in it. Played in it. Learned to tie those laces with small, clumsy fingers. And now it was here, in this dark passage, abandoned like everything else the witch had taken. *How old? Six? Seven?*

How many? How many shoes, how many lockets, how many fragments of lives cut short lay forgotten in these shadows?

The thrall's swaying shadow passed across the main corridor behind them, elongated and distorted in the torchlight. It didn't turn, its jerking movements carrying it past their hiding place.

Theron heard the second one now—shuffling footsteps, slow and uneven, dragging across stone. A wet rattling breath, phlegmy and labored, echoing in the passage. It was close. *Too* close. His heart hammered against his ribs so hard he thought the thrall must hear it.

Sera pressed flat against the wall, sword hand trembling with the effort of staying still. Tomren did the same, going absolutely still—that hunter's stillness, breathing slowed almost to nothing, absorbing every sound. Theron held his breath until his lungs burned, pulse thundering in his ears.

*Shuffle. Shuffle. Pause.*

The thrall stood at the intersection, inches away—so close Theron could have reached out and touched it. He could smell it—rot and old blood and something chemically *wrong*, sharp and nauseating, making his eyes water. Its head turned slowly, nostrils flaring as it sniffed the air. Looking for them. *Smelling* for them.

Whisper's claws dug into his neck, tiny pinpoints of pain. A warning. The familiar had gone completely rigid, not even breathing.

*Don't move. Don't breathe. Don't—*

Through the gap between the walls, Theron saw the thrall's profile, illuminated by distant torchlight. Half its face was covered in ritual scars—the witch's marks, burned into dead flesh, raised and weeping. Its mouth hung open, jaw slack, revealing teeth filed to points, blackened and broken. Its tongue moved, tasting the air. A low moan escaped its throat, barely human.

*What did she do to you?*

The thrall stood there for an eternity—five seconds, ten, fifteen—head tilted, listening, sniffing. Theron's lungs screamed for air. Black spots danced in his vision.

Then, finally, the thrall moved on, shuffling deeper into the dungeons, that wet rattling breath fading into the darkness.

---

Theron waited a full minute before exhaling.

"That was too close for comfort," Tomren whispered, breath still controlled.

"Actually, that was *necessary*," Theron countered. "If we'd fought, the other would have raised the alarm. Now we're past them both, and they don't know we're here."

Sera said nothing, but her hand briefly squeezed his shoulder.

---

**The Passage Ascends**

The narrow corridor sloped upward, carved stairs emerging from the stone—ancient, worn smooth by centuries of use. This wasn't part of the dungeon proper. It was older. Part of whatever had existed here before the witch claimed it.

"Servants' passage," Whisper murmured. "She sealed most of them off, but this one..." He paused, sniffing. "This one she forgot. Or chose to ignore."

"Where does this passage lead?"

"If I remember correctly... the kitchens. Abandoned now. She doesn't eat—not food, anyway."

"And from the kitchens? What access points?"

"Access to the main hall. The study. The ritual chamber." His voice dropped. "And her private quarters."

---

Theron climbed in silence, legs burning with the effort, thighs cramping from the endless stairs. Each step worn smooth by centuries of use, the stone cold beneath his wet boots. The stairs seemed endless—spiraling upward through the guts of the castle, narrow and steep, one hand on the wall for balance. The walls grew drier as they climbed, the damp chill giving way to something warmer but no less oppressive. The air grew warmer, stuffier, smelling less of mold and more of torch smoke and old stone. Torchlight began to seep through cracks in the stonework, pale orange lines in the darkness.

Then—voices, drifting down from above.

Theron froze.

Not thralls. *Words*. Muffled, distant, but unmistakably speech. Tomren went utterly still behind them, head tilted, absorbing every syllable.

*"...the binding holds, but she grows impatient..."*

*"...the sacrifice must be prepared by the third moon..."*

*"...what of the escaped prisoner?..."*

A long pause.

*"...irrelevant now. The Herald stirs. Nothing else matters..."*

The voices faded, footsteps retreating.

Sera's eyes met his in the darkness. *The witch has servants. Human ones.*

"Cultists," Whisper confirmed grimly. "She's been recruiting. Promising power, immortality, the usual lies."

"How many cultists total?"

"Unknown. At least a handful. Possibly more."

A low hum escaped Tomren's throat as he calculated. Then he adjusted his crossbow tension—*click-click-click*—the sound barely audible but familiar. "More targets to account for."

"More *complications*," Sera corrected, hand shifting her sword position slightly. "Threat assessment just increased."

---

**The Abandoned Kitchen**

Theron emerged through a crumbling doorway into a vast, decayed space. Stone ovens lined one wall, cold and dark, their mouths yawning like empty caves. Rusted pots hung from hooks, coated in thick grime, some so corroded they'd fused to the metal. A long wooden table—rotted, collapsed in the middle like a broken spine—dominated the center of the room. Shattered pottery littered the floor, crunching softly beneath their boots.

Dust lay thick on everything, motes swirling in the faint light from cracks in the ceiling, coating their throats, making them want to cough. The air tasted stale, ancient, undisturbed for decades. Cobwebs hung in corners like funeral shrouds, thick and gray.

But through the far doorway, they saw torchlight flickering against stone. Movement—shadows passing. Voices, distant but audible. The castle proper. The living parts. And underneath the decay, underneath the dust and mold—that smell again. Blood. Old and dried, but *so much of it* that the scent had soaked into the very stones, into the mortar between, a permanent stain. The metallic tang was overwhelming, coating their tongues.

"We're inside the castle proper now," Theron breathed.

Whisper hopped from his shoulder onto the collapsed table, surveying the exits.

"Three paths from here. Left leads to the great hall—that's where the ritual chamber connects. Straight leads to the upper corridors—the study, her quarters. Right leads to the old tower—storage, mostly, but also..."

He hesitated.

"Also what?" Sera demanded, voice sharp.

"The cells where she keeps *special* prisoners. The ones she wants to preserve."

Sera went very still.

"Elina."

"Possibly. If she's alive, if the witch values her for some reason—that's where she'd be."

---

*Three paths. Three objectives.*

The study held his spellbook—his power, his identity, his best chance at turning the tide.

The ritual chamber held Szeth-Kaan—the true threat, the ticking clock, the thing that would erase Millhaven from existence if left unchecked.

The old tower held Elina—a mother's daughter, an innocent, the reason Sera was here at all.

Theron couldn't do all three at once. Not without splitting up.

But before anyone could speak, Whisper went rigid on the table. His whiskers quivered, nostrils flaring.

"Wait." The familiar's voice was sharp. "I smell... blood. Fresh. And something else. Ritual components. Activated ones."

A chill ran down Theron's spine. "What does that mean? The timing—"

"It means she's not waiting." Whisper's eyes were wide. "The voices said 'third moon,' but that's—" He counted on tiny claws. "That's *tonight*. She's accelerating. The ritual is happening *now*."

---

## Breaking the Promise

Sera moved immediately toward the right corridor—toward the tower, toward Elina. Her hand found the locket at her throat, gripping it tight enough that her knuckles went white, the chain biting into her neck. "Move fast, then. Extract her first per the plan, then—"

"No." Theron's voice was sharper than he intended, echoing in the dead kitchen. "We can't."

She whirled on him, boots scraping on the dusty floor. "We *agreed*. In the forest. Elina first. You *promised*." Her eyes blazed, scarred face tight with fury and fear.

"I know what we agreed—"

"Then we execute the plan!" Her voice cracked, raw with emotion. "My daughter is in that tower. Right there. *Right there*." She gestured violently toward the corridor, hand shaking. "We are not—"

"The ritual is happening *now*, Sera." Theron took a step closer, keeping his voice low but urgent. "Let me think this through—if Szeth-Kaan completes its work, none of us walk out. Not you, not me, not Tomren, and not Elina. The demon will erase this entire castle, everyone in it, and everything we are from existence."

"Then we move *faster*—"

"There's no such thing as fast enough!" His frustration bled through, academic precision sharpening. "Without my spellbook, I'm useless against whatever's waiting in that ritual chamber. Cantrips won't stop an ancient herald. Minor illusions won't disrupt a binding circle." He met her eyes. "You need me at full power. And I need that book."

Sera's fingers traced the locket at her throat—around the edge, over the clasp, again and again. A lifeline. Her other hand had formed a fist at her side, trembling, nails digging into her palm hard enough to draw blood.

"You're asking me to leave her." Her voice was barely a whisper, thick with unshed tears. "Walk past. Choose *magic* over my child." Her breath came faster, shorter, chest heaving.

"I'm asking you to trust that the best way to save her is to stop the thing that will kill her anyway."

"No." Sera shook her head violently, white hair coming loose from its braid, falling across her scarred face. "No. We made a deal. You *agreed*—Elina first, study second. Those were your words. Looked me in the eye and—" Her voice broke completely, the last word dissolving into a choked sound.

Tomren stepped between them, his bulk filling the space.

"Sera." His voice was gentle but firm. "Listen to me for a moment."

"Don't, Tomren. Don't you dare take his side—"

"I'm taking *reality's* side." He gripped both her shoulders, forcing her to look at him. "The circumstances changed. That conversation we overheard—'the Herald stirs,' 'the sacrifice must be prepared'—this isn't happening in three days. It's happening *tonight*."

"So we save her *now*—"

"And fight the witch with a wizard who can barely cast?" Tomren's voice hardened. "I've seen what happens when good soldiers die because commanders ignored the facts on the ground. I've *been* that soldier, bleeding out in the mud because someone was too proud to adapt to reality."

Sera's eyes shone with unshed tears, the torchlight catching the wetness, making them gleam. Her thumb pressed against the locket so hard it left a deep red mark on her skin, the metal biting into flesh. "She's been in there for six months. Six months of terror, not knowing if anyone was coming. And now I'm here—*finally here*—and you want me to walk past her cell? Prioritize *books*?" The last word came out bitter, spat like poison.

"I want you to prioritize *success*." Tomren didn't let go, his large hands steady on her shoulders. "I want you to get her out alive. Not die trying because we rushed in half-armed against an ancient demon."

"We had a plan—"

"Plans change when the situation changes." His voice gentled, rough with emotion. "You taught me that. Kren's Crossing, remember? We had a plan there too. Went to hell in the first five minutes. And you *adapted*. Changed tactics, saved half the garrison, saved *me*." He squeezed her shoulders, trying to ground her. "Do that now. Adapt. Choose the path that actually gets your daughter home."

Silence filled the kitchen, broken only by the distant drip of water and their ragged breathing.

Sera stood there, trembling—her whole body shaking like a leaf in a storm. Her fingers traced the locket over and over—desperate circles, a prayer made physical, the metal warming from the repetition. Her jaw worked, muscles jumping beneath her skin. Her eyes squeezed shut, sending two tears streaming down her scarred face, carving clean lines through the dust and grime. Her breath came in short gasps, each one sounding like it hurt.

"I can't..." The words choked out, barely audible, throat closing around them. "I can't just leave her. Not when she's this close." A sob broke free, raw and broken.

"You're not leaving her." Theron's voice is softer now. "You're ensuring she has a mother who survives to rescue her. That's not abandonment. That's love."

More tears escaped, tracking down Sera's scarred face, following the path of old wounds. Her lips trembled. Her hands shook.

"What if she thinks I chose wrong? What if she's in there, listening, hearing footsteps go past her cell..." Her voice broke completely, the words dissolving into ragged breathing. "What if she thinks I didn't come for her?" The question came out as a wail, primal and broken, a mother's worst fear given voice.

The weight of the question hung heavy in the dusty air.

Tomren spoke, his gruff voice thick with emotion, rough as gravel. "Then we'll tell her the truth. That you made the hardest choice a mother can make. Put her survival above your need to hold her. That you were willing to endure that pain so she wouldn't have to endure death."

Sera's shoulders shook violently. One sob escaped, then another, then more—harsh, gasping sounds torn from deep in her chest. Her hand dropped from the locket, fingers opening slowly as if releasing something precious, the chain falling back against her armor with a soft clink. Tears streamed freely now, hot against her cold cheeks.

Then, slowly, painfully, she straightened. Wiped her face roughly with her sleeve, the fabric scraping across her skin, smearing the tears and dust. Rolled her shoulders once, twice—soldier's discipline reasserting itself through sheer force of will, muscles tensing and releasing. Her jaw set. Her hands steadied.

"One hour," she said, voice raw but steady. "Get the spellbook. Prepare. Then—" She looked toward the tower corridor, longing and grief warring in her expression. "Then nothing in this castle keeps me from her. Not the witch. Not her thralls. Not Szeth-Kaan itself."

She turned to Theron, and the look in her eyes was terrifying in its intensity.

"But if we fail because of this choice—if I lose her because I listened to you—" Her hand moved to her sword. "Won't be enough magic in the world to save you from me."

"Understood."

Whisper shifted on the table. "I hate to interrupt the emotional moment, but we have perhaps twenty minutes before the next patrol cycle. If we're doing this, we need to move. *Now*."

Sera took one last look toward the tower corridor—toward where her daughter waited, unknowing, alone, afraid. Her eyes lingered on the darkness of the passage, straining as if she could see through stone and shadow to where Elina lay. Her fingers brushed the locket one final time, trembling, the touch tender as a caress, then fell away—heavy, reluctant, like cutting off a part of herself. Her face was a mask of grief, jaw clenched so tight the muscles stood out like cords, eyes red and wet.

Then, slowly, as if every movement cost her something irreplaceable, she turned toward the study corridor. Away from her daughter. Toward duty. Toward survival.

"Lead the way, wizard." Her voice was raw, scraped hollow.

The words sounded like ashes in her mouth, bitter and dead.

# Chapter 8: The Study

**The Upper Corridors**

Theron took the center path, climbing another narrow staircase that groaned beneath his weight, wood creaking with each step, centuries-old timbers protesting. The architecture shifted as he ascended—newer stonework grafted onto ancient bones, the mortar crumbling between mismatched stones; tapestries covering older symbols, the fabric moth-eaten and musty, smelling of age and decay; the witch's centuries of habitation layered like sediment, each era leaving its mark.

The air grew warmer as they climbed. Thicker, harder to breathe, pressing into his lungs. Magic saturated everything here; he felt it pressing against his skin like invisible hands, raising goosebumps, making his hair stand on end. It tasted his presence, metallic and sharp on his tongue, making his teeth ache. The sensation was intrusive, invasive—like being watched from the inside out.

"She knows the castle's been breached," Whisper warned. "Not *where*. Not *who*. But she feels the disturbance. We have maybe twenty minutes before she starts actively searching."

"We have twenty minutes maximum." Theron's thumb traced across his knuckles. "That gives us a window if we move efficiently."

---

The corridor opened into a gallery—tall windows overlooking the storm-lashed valley, rain hammering against the glass, lightning flashing across dark clouds. Portraits lined the walls in heavy gilt frames, the air thick with the smell of old paint and varnish and something underneath—something stale and wrong. Theron paused despite himself, boots echoing on polished marble.

The portraits were *wrong*.

Each depicted the same woman—the witch, presumably—but across centuries. Different fashions, different settings, different eras. The painted eyes gleamed with an unnatural wetness, as if freshly done despite centuries of age. And in each one, her eyes seemed to *follow* him, tracking his movement across the gallery. Not an artistic trick—he could *feel* them watching, assessing, knowing. The sensation crawled across his skin like insects.

"Don't look at them," Whisper hissed. "They're not just paintings."

But Theron was already looking. Behind him, Tomren had gone utterly still—that hunter's silence that meant he was listening, assessing. His crossbow clicked softly: click-click-click.

Because the first portrait showed a child.

---

**The Gallery**

The first painting: a young girl, perhaps ten years old, in simple peasant clothes. Dark hair in braids. She held wildflowers—the same white blooms that grew wild in the forest—and smiled at something beyond the frame. A modest cottage stood in the background.

The second: older, fourteen maybe. The braids gone. Standing alone in a clearing, arms wrapped around herself. Faint marks on her hands—burns, if you looked closely.

The third: twenty. Dark robes now. The burns had spread up her arms, across her neck, but they'd changed—deliberate patterns, not accidental scars. Behind her, shadows moved in painted flames. Seven of them.

The gallery continued. Each portrait the same woman, aging, then *not* aging. The patterns on her skin glowed brighter with each decade. Her expression grew colder. By the hundredth year, she looked younger than the twentieth. The cottage from the first portrait appeared again in one—burning.

The final portrait showed her as she was now. Ageless. Beautiful in the way a knife was beautiful. Her eyes followed him as he moved.

A small brass plate beneath: *Morganna*

No dates. No explanation. Just a name.

"Wizard," Whisper's voice was urgent. "We need to keep moving."

But Theron looked back at the first portrait. The child with wildflowers. His thumb traced its familiar path across his knuckles—index to pinky—as he processed what he was seeing.

Ten years old. Still human.

---

**The Study Door**

Theron found it at the end of a torch-lit hallway—a heavy oak door, iron-banded and studded, carved with symbols that writhed at the edges of his vision. Looking directly at them made his eyes water, tears streaming down his cheeks, a pounding headache building behind his eyes. He had to look away, blinking the burn from his vision.

Wards. *Powerful* ones. He could feel them even at this distance—a pressure in the air, a low hum beneath the threshold of hearing that made his bones vibrate.

"This is it," Whisper confirmed, whiskers twitching. "Your spellbook is inside. I can smell the leather, the ink, *you*." The familiar's small nose worked, nostrils flaring.

Sera and Tomren took positions flanking the door, weapons ready, eyes scanning the corridor behind them. Sera's hand drifted to her locket—a brief touch, thumb pressing against the metal—before she rolled her shoulders once, twice, and adjusted her sword position with a soft scrape of leather. Theron approached the wards, pulling the pouch of powdered iron from his belt, the contents shifting with a soft whisper. His fingers trembled slightly as he loosened the drawstring.

"Can you breach them?" Sera asked, her voice clipped and focused.

Theron studied the symbols, his thumb working across his knuckles in steady rhythm—index, middle, ring, pinky. Three layers of protection: an alarm ward, a paralysis trap, and something deeper—something that felt like *teeth*.

*The patterns unfolded before him like a language he'd forgotten he knew.*

"Let me think... the alarm is keyed to hostile intent—if I approach wanting to *take*, it triggers." He traced the symbols without touching them. "But if I approach wanting to *reclaim*—to retrieve what's already mine—the ward can't distinguish ownership. It's a conceptual loophole in the ward architecture. Sloppy work, honestly."

"The paralysis trap?"

"Iron negates it through standard thaumic disruption. That's what the powdered iron is for." He sprinkled a careful line across the threshold. "The third ward, however..."

Theron hesitated.

"Let me think... the third ward is a *guardian*. Something bound into the door itself. It won't stop me from entering, but it will alert her the moment I cross the threshold."

"Can you disable it?"

"No. But I can delay the signal." He pulled out the salt pouch. "A circle of protection, placed correctly, can muffle the signal. Buy us approximately five minutes before she realizes exactly where we are."

Sera nodded grimly. "Five minutes. We'll need extraction protocols ready."

---

Theron completed the circle, pouring salt in a careful line, the white grains hissing faintly as they hit the stone. He felt the magic settle into place—a dampening field, fragile but functional, pushing back against the wards with a pressure he could feel in his chest. The guardian ward pulsed angrily, the sensation like a wasp trapped in a jar, buzzing furiously but unable to break through. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cool air.

"Now." His voice was steady despite his racing heart.

Theron placed his hand on the door, the wood cool and smooth beneath his palm. He focused on the truth, letting it fill his mind, his intention: *This is mine. I am reclaiming what was taken. I am not a thief. I am the owner.* The ward pressed against his thoughts, probing, questioning, sharp tendrils of magic searching for deception.

The alarm ward flickered, its glow dimming then brightening, uncertain.

Wavered, the magic caught between acceptance and rejection.

*Accepted.*

The door swung open with a soft creak of hinges, releasing a wave of warmer air thick with the smell of old parchment and chemical reagents.

---

**The Witch's Study**

The room beyond was everything he expected and nothing he imagined.

Bookshelves climbed to the ceiling, groaning under the weight of tomes in languages dead and living—leather bindings cracked with age, pages yellowed and brittle, the air thick with the musty smell of ancient paper and binding glue. Alchemical apparatus cluttered a long table—bubbling vials releasing thin wisps of acrid smoke, the liquid inside glowing faintly; crystallized compounds sparkling in the torchlight like shattered glass; something that might be a heart suspended in amber, dark red and perfectly preserved, veins still visible. The smell was overwhelming—sulfur and mercury, old blood and ozone, making his nose burn and his eyes water. Star charts covered one wall, the parchment crackling when air moved across them. A stuffed raven watched from a perch, glass eyes glinting with reflected firelight, feathers dusty and moth-eaten.

But what caught Theron's attention first wasn't his spellbook—though he could *feel* it, calling to him from across the room like a siren song, pulling at something deep in his chest.

It was the small shrine on the desk, illuminated by a single candle that had burned down to almost nothing.

---

**Morganna's Past**

Tucked in the corner of the desk, almost hidden among ritual diagrams and ingredient lists: a child's rag doll, scorched black on one side. Button eyes half-melted.

Beside it, dried wildflowers preserved by magic. White blooms, long dead.

A wooden box, carved with crude symbols. Theron opened it.

Inside: ashes. A few scraps of parchment, edges burned away. The handwriting had changed from page to page—child's scrawl becoming elegant script becoming something sharp and angular.

*—voices in the forest. Mother says they're dangerous but they saved me when—*

*—all of them. I can still smell—*

*—power tastes like copper and—*

Most of it was illegible. Fire damage, or deliberately burned. Only fragments remained.

Sera appeared at his shoulder. "What is that?"

Theron closed the box. "Personal effects. Something she kept from before her transformation."

He set it down and turned to the bookshelves.

---

**The Journals**

Decades of them, lined up on a shelf. Theron pulled one from forty years ago.

*Attempt Seventeen. Age 19. Common blood. Rejected within minutes. Must search farther.*

Another, eighty years back:

*Seven hearts at the moment of death. The thralls are sufficient. They feel no pain anymore.*

And one from over a century past, the handwriting less controlled:

*I see the child I was in dreams sometimes. She holds her flowers and asks me why.*

Theron closed it.

"Anything useful?" Sera asked.

"Just confirmation of the timeline," Theron said. "She's been conducting these rituals for over a century."

---

**The Spellbook**

Theron's eyes finally settled on what he'd come for.

There—on a pedestal beside the window, displayed like a trophy—

**His spellbook.**

It was unharmed. The leather binding gleamed in the torchlight, the silver clasp catching the flickering flames. He felt it calling to him, a piece of his soul crying out for reunion.

But he didn't rush forward. He'd been a prisoner once already.

"Whisper. What traps are we looking at?"

The familiar scurried across the floor, circling the pedestal, sniffing, examining.

"Pressure plate beneath the pedestal. Remove the book without disabling it, and..." He tilted his head. "Crossbow bolts. From the walls. At least six."

"Can you disable it?"

"Can *you*?"

Theron spotted it—a thin wire running from the pedestal's base to a hidden panel in the wall. He traced it backward, found the release catch, and...

*Click.*

The mechanism went dead.

---

Theron approached the pedestal slowly, reverently. His hands trembled—not from fear, but from *anticipation*, from need so acute it hurt. Without thinking, his fingers found his component pouch, checking the familiar weight against his hip, the gesture automatic and reassuring. Six days ago, he was a complete wizard, confident in his power. Three days ago, he was a prisoner, stripped of everything, reduced to cantrips and desperation. Now...

Theron lifted the spellbook, his hands wrapping around the familiar leather binding.

*It was like breathing again after being underwater.*

The leather warmed to his touch immediately, recognizing him, welcoming him home. The pages fluttered slightly, rustling like whispers, as if greeting him. He felt his prepared spells settling back into place—*Fireball*, *Counterspell*, *Misty Step*, *Hold Person*—a dozen weapons returning to his arsenal, slots in his mind filling with power and possibility. The sensation was euphoric, dizzying, like missing pieces of himself clicking back together. His breathing steadied. His hands stopped trembling. The hollow feeling in his chest eased slightly.

"Hello, old friend," he murmured, voice thick with emotion, fingers tracing the silver clasp.

"Touching reunion," Sera said tightly. "Component pouch status?"

Theron scanned the room. There—a cabinet against the far wall. He crossed to it, pulled it open, and found...

*Everything.*

Not just his component pouch, but the witch's own supplies. Bat guano. Diamond dust. Sulfur. Phosphorus. Feathers of every description. A small fortune in spell components, accumulated over centuries.

Theron grabbed his own pouch first—*his*, familiar, comfortable—then began stuffing it with everything useful he could carry.

"Two minutes," Whisper warned. "The dampening circle is weakening."

"Acknowledged." Sera moved to the door, scanning the corridor. "We move in one-twenty."

---

**Inventory Updated:**

- **Spellbook** — RECOVERED
- **Component Pouch** — RECOVERED (fully stocked)
- **Additional Components:** Diamond dust (50gp worth), mercury vial, owl feather, phosphorus sticks
- **Prepared Spells Available:** *Fireball, Counterspell, Misty Step, Hold Person, Dispel Magic, Fly, Lightning Bolt, Shield, Mirror Image, Detect Magic*

---

**The Journal**

As Theron turned from the cabinet, his eye caught a leather-bound journal on the desk. It lay open, ink still wet on the latest entry. The witch's journal.

His hands trembled as he reached for it. His thumb traced across his knuckles—index, middle, ring, pinky—a grounding gesture before he touched the page. The leather was warm to the touch, as if centuries of dark magic had seeped into the binding itself.

He flipped through pages of formulae, ritual diagrams, transaction records—

Then froze.

**Attempt One: The Szeth-Kaan Binding**
*Date: Eight years past, autumn*
*Subject: Lucian A.*
*Age: 15*
*Background: Self-taught. Promising. Hungry for knowledge.*

*The boy came willingly. They always do. He brought translations of the Old Texts, thinking I would teach him. Instead, I taught him the true price of ambition.*

*The ritual began at midnight. Subject was positioned within the primary circle. Incantations performed correctly. The void opened. Szeth-Kaan's attention... magnificent. Terrible.*

*But the bloodline was insufficient. The resonance weak. The Herald requires ancient magic, power running through generations. This boy's gift was... new. Raw. Not enough.*

*Subject expired during the binding process at approximately 3:47am. The Herald rejected the offering. The connection collapsed.*

*Disposal: Oubliette. Fourth level.*

*Conclusion: Must find subject with established magical lineage. Preferably wizard family, multiple generations. The Herald will not accept common blood.*

*Note: The boy's last words were "Father, I'm sorry." Curious. Wonder if anyone will come looking for him. They never do.*

The journal slipped from Theron's fingers, hitting the desk with a dull thud that seemed impossibly loud in the sudden silence.

*Lucian.*

His thumb moved across his knuckles. Index. Middle. Ring. Pinky. Again. Index. Middle. Ring. Pinky. The familiar pattern couldn't stop the trembling—his whole hand shook, then his arm, then his entire body. His breath came in short, sharp gasps. His vision blurred.

Eight years. Eight years Lucian had been bones in a pit—*bones*, his son reduced to bones—while he searched. While he hoped. While he told himself Lucian was alive somewhere, just waiting to be found.

*"Father, I'm sorry."*

The last words. His son's last words, dying in this castle, calling for him. And Theron hadn't been there. Hadn't known. Had been teaching students about spell theory while Lucian *died* in agony, rejected by a demon, discarded like refuse.

His hand found his component pouch—empty, he'd just refilled it—but his fingers pressed against the leather anyway, gripping it hard enough to hurt, seeking something solid, something *real*, something to anchor him before he flew apart completely. His knees weakened. He caught himself against the desk, palm slapping against wood.

"Wizard?" Sera's voice, sharp with concern. "Status report. What did you find?"

He couldn't speak. Couldn't breathe. The room spun, walls tilting, floor dropping away beneath him. His throat had closed, air trapped in his lungs. Words bubbled up unbidden—*"Ignis... fortis... lux..."*—fragments of incantations spilling from his lips in a barely audible whisper, desperate and broken, his mind reaching for the structure of magic when reality had become unbearable. *"Praesidium... tenebris... mortis..."* The Latin gave him something to hold onto, patterns when everything else was chaos.

Whisper's claws dug into his shoulder, tiny pinpoints of pain cutting through the fog. "Theron. We don't have time for—" The familiar paused, reading something in his posture—the way he was doubled over the desk, shoulders heaving, one hand white-knuckled on the component pouch. "*Ventus... arcana... mortis...*" The whispered incantations continued, barely audible over Theron's ragged breathing. "What did she write?"

"My son." The words came out broken, barely recognizable, torn from somewhere deep in his chest. His voice cracked on both words. His thumb traced the pattern again—index to pinky, over and over, frantic now. "She... he came here. Eight years ago." A gasping breath. "She used him. He wasn't strong enough for her ritual." Another breath, this one hitching into something like a sob. "He *died* here."

Sera's expression shifted—recognition, shared grief flooding her scarred face. She knew. She *knew* what it meant to lose a child to this place, to carry that weight, to live with the not-knowing that had just become the terrible knowing. Her hand found her locket, holding it tight enough that her knuckles went white.

"I'm sorry," she said quietly, her clipped tactical edge softening for just a moment. She didn't offer false hope, didn't say useless words, didn't tell him it would be okay. Just: "I'm sorry." Simple. True. Her tactical mind was already working—he could see it in the way her eyes scanned the room, the subtle shift of her stance, always assessing threats—but her grief was genuine. She understood.

Theron bent and retrieved the journal with shaking hands, each finger trembling as he grasped the leather binding. His component pouch pressed against his palm as he reached down—the weight of it grounding him just enough to move, to function, to not collapse completely. He tore out the page—gently, reverently, the paper whispering as it separated from the binding—and folded it into his robes with careful precision, against his heart, the parchment crinkling softly. He could feel it there, a small square of weight over his sternum. The last evidence of his son's existence.

"The oubliette," he said, voice hollow, scraped raw. His thumb moved: index, middle, ring, pinky. The pattern steadying him, giving him something to count. "Fourth level. I need to... let me think, the structural access from here would be—" His voice trailed off, mind already mapping corridors, calculating distances to his son's bones.

"Later," Whisper said firmly, claws digging in just enough to get his attention. "Right now, we finish this. We save Elina. We end the witch. *Then* you grieve. *Then* you honor him properly."

The familiar was right. Lucian was eight years gone—bones in darkness, beyond help, beyond rescue. Elina was alive, waiting, *now*. She could still be saved. He could still save *someone's* child.

But Theron made a promise to the dust that had once been his son, the words forming silently behind his teeth, tasting of ash and grief:

*She'll pay. For what she did to you. For your last words that I never heard. For the eight years she let me hope. And when this is over, I'll bring you home. I swear it. I'll bring you home.*

His hand pressed against the folded page over his heart. One more breath. Then another. His thumb traced: index, middle, ring, pinky. He straightened, spine stiffening, wizard's discipline overriding father's grief.

---

Theron turned to face his companions, spellbook in hand, power thrumming through his veins. One final touch to his component pouch—the familiar weight restored, but the emptiness inside him remained.

"Now," he said quietly, "we're ready."

Sera's grim expression softened—just slightly. She rolled her shoulders, settling her sword into position with practiced precision.

"Then let's extract my daughter."

Tomren checked his crossbow, the tension mechanism clicking softly—click-click-click—as he positioned himself at Sera's back. "We need to end the witch tonight."

Whisper climbed to his shoulder. "And banish an ancient horror from beyond the stars. Don't forget that part."

---

*The dampening circle flickered.*

*Somewhere in the castle, the witch raised her head.*

*She knew.*

---

# Chapter 9: The Wait

Theron said quickly, his mind racing through possibilities, adrenaline sharpening his thoughts. "We're not running. We're *hunting*."

Sera's eyebrow rose, scarred face skeptical. "Sitrep. Now."

"She's coming here. Right now." He was already moving, boots scraping on stone, pulling components from his pouch—fleece, salt, powdered silver. His fingers fumbled slightly with urgency. "She expects to find intruders fumbling through her wards—instead, she'll find an empty room, exactly as she left it. The cognitive dissonance will force her to second-guess herself. Lower her guard. And when she does..."

Theron bared his teeth in something that wasn't quite a smile, more grimace than grin.

"We spring the trap."

Sera exchanged a glance with Tomren. The soldier's jaw tightened, but he nodded.

"High risk," Sera said. But she was already checking her blade, positioning herself. "Contingency plan?"

"If it doesn't work, we were dead anyway. Let me be precise about this—" Theron's hands moved through component pouches with practiced precision. "At least this way, we control the variables. We choose the ground."

---

## Phase One: The Illusion

Theron reached for the fleece in his component pouch—*Major Image* requires concentration, but the payoff is worth it.

"Everyone against the walls. Complete stillness is essential—even breathing needs to be minimal."

Sera and Tomren flattened themselves into the shadows behind the door. Theron positioned himself behind the bookshelf, line of sight to the pedestal.

Then he cast, fingers moving through practiced gestures, fleece crumbling between his fingers.

The incantation whispered through his lips, each syllable precise, tongue and teeth shaping sounds older than language. The weave of the spell built in his mind's eye—threads of illusion, light, and perception woven together like a tapestry, each strand needing perfect tension. He could feel it taking shape, the magic responding to his will, warm and electric under his skin. He'd practiced this spell a thousand times, but never with this much at stake. His heart pounded. Sweat beaded on his forehead.

The room shimmered like heat haze and *settled*. Where the pedestal stood empty, his spellbook now appeared—a perfect replica, leather gleaming with the exact pattern of wear, silver clasp catching the torchlight at the precise angle. The cabinet doors closed themselves with barely a whisper of wood on wood. The dust redistributed across surfaces with a faint sigh, settling into the exact patterns they'd disturbed. Every sign of their presence erased itself like words wiped from a slate, backwards through time.

Even the scorch marks from the fire Theron had started returned, perfectly mimicking how the room had looked before they'd disturbed it.

"Impressive," Whisper murmured from deep within his hood.

"I'm just getting started."

---

## Phase Two: Mirror Image

Theron whispered the incantation, feeling the magic split and refract. Three illusory duplicates shimmered into existence around him, each one perfect, each one moving with his breath.

*Four targets. One real. Good luck, witch.*

---

## Phase Three: The Wait

Silence fell.

Theron pressed his back against the bookshelf, feeling the ancient wood dig into his spine, sharp edges of the shelving biting into his shoulder blades. His breath came shallow and controlled—years of meditation practice keeping his chest from rising visibly, each inhale measured and silent. The mirror images around him mimicked the stillness perfectly, breathing when he breathed.

In the dungeon, he'd had nothing but time. Hours stretching into days, fear dulled by routine and exhaustion, the ache becoming familiar. But this—this was *active* terror. Knowing she was coming. Knowing that in moments, he'd face someone who had casually captured him, drained dozens of victims, and bargained with demons for centuries of life. His pulse thundered in his ears. His throat felt tight.

*What made him think he could win?*

His teacher's voice echoed in memory: *"Doubt before battle is wisdom. Doubt during battle is death. Know which you're in."*

He forced the thought away with effort, jaw clenching. Focused on the plan. On the spellbook he'd recovered—warm against his chest, a solid weight. On the friends hiding in the shadows with him, trusting him to get this right. Trusting him with their lives.

*Don't think. Just wait.*

The storm raged outside, rain hammering the windows, lightning illuminating the room in staccato bursts of white brilliance. Thunder rolled across the valley, shaking the castle's foundations, vibrating through the stone walls and floor. Each flash threw harsh shadows across the room, making the illusory spellbook gleam with false promise.

Minutes crawled past like hours, each second distinct and agonizing.

Theron's legs began to ache from standing motionless—first the calves cramping, then his thighs burning, then his lower back seizing up. The bookshelf edge dug deeper into his spine. His concentration wavered—maintaining the *Major Image* required constant focus, a background hum of magic threading through his mind that couldn't slip even for a moment, draining his mental reserves drop by drop. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cold, running into his eyes, stinging, but he couldn't wipe it away. His nose itched. A muscle in his calf twitched, threatening to spasm.

Across the room, barely visible in the darkness, Sera hadn't moved. But he could see the tension in her shoulders, the white-knuckled grip on her sword. She'd been hunting this witch for six months. All that rage, all that fear for Elina—compressed into this single moment of stillness.

If this went wrong, they'd die here. All of them.

Whisper trembled against his neck, the familiar's body pressed flat against his skin beneath his robes.

"Second thoughts?" the rat whispered, voice barely audible even in the silence.

*So many.*

"Too late for that," Theron breathed back.

"She's close. Very close. And she's not alone."

The air pressure changed. Theron felt it before he heard anything—a *weight* descending on the castle, like storm clouds gathering directly overhead, pressing down on his chest and shoulders, making it harder to breathe. The magic in the walls bent and flexed, responding to her presence the way metal shavings align to a lodestone. The temperature dropped five degrees in an instant. The hairs on his arms stood up. His breath misted white.

She was coming.

His heart hammered against his ribs, so hard it hurt, so loud he was certain she'd hear it. The spell flickered—just for an instant, the illusory spellbook wavering like a mirage—before he clamped down on his concentration with desperate force, sweat now pouring down his temples.

"Cultists?" he whispered, barely a breath, lips barely moving.

"One. Maybe two. And..." Whisper paused, body going rigid against his neck. "Something else. Something that doesn't breathe."

*Szeth-Kaan's influence. A manifestation. Or worse.*

The air tasted wrong now—metallic and cold, like licking copper in winter.

Sera's hand tightened on her sword, knuckles white in the darkness. Tomren raised his crossbow with agonizing slowness, the wood creaking so softly only they could hear, finger resting beside the trigger. The soldier's breathing had gone perfectly silent—a trick Theron had only seen from trained hunters, breath held in the lungs without strain.

Footsteps echoed in the corridor, muffled by stone but growing louder.

Not hurried. Not cautious. *Confident*. The measured pace of someone walking through their own domain, expecting no resistance, fearing nothing.

Getting closer. Each footfall distinct, unhurried, inevitable.

Theron's mind raced through the plan. Sera would strike first—she was closest to the door. Tomren's bolt would take the second cultist. Theron's illusions would confuse, and then—

*And then we hope we're fast enough.*

The footsteps stopped outside the door.

Time crystallized. Each heartbeat distinct and separate. Each breath a conscious choice.

This was it. No more planning. No more doubt.

The door would open, and everything would happen at once.

---

**The Door Opens**

She entered like a queen surveying her domain, movements fluid and wrong.

The Witch of Thornhollow was tall—impossibly so, nearly seven feet, as if her bones had been stretched by centuries of dark magic, proportions subtly inhuman. Her hair was white and wild, cascading past her waist in tangled waves that moved as if in unseen wind. Her skin had the pallor of something that hadn't seen true sunlight in decades—not pale, but *bloodless*, like marble or corpse flesh, stretched too tight over angular bones. She smelled of ozone and old blood and something floral that had rotted. And her eyes...

Her eyes were *wrong*. Black where they should be white, like pools of ink, with pupils that burned like dying stars—pinpoints of red light in the darkness. Looking at them made Theron's stomach turn, made his vision blur at the edges, made every instinct scream *run*.

Around her neck, Theron saw it: **his component pouch**. Worn like a trophy on a leather cord, swaying with her movements, just as Whisper had said. The sight sent a spike of rage through his chest—hot and fierce—quickly suppressed with effort. Emotion was luxury. Control was survival. But his jaw clenched. His fingers tightened.

Behind her stood two robed cultists, faces hidden beneath deep hoods, the fabric stained and rank. And between them, floating a foot off the ground, was a *shape*—humanoid but hollow, a silhouette cut from reality itself, edges flickering like a candle flame in wind. The air around it rippled and bent. Looking at it hurt, made his eyes water, made his head pound. It didn't cast a shadow. It made no sound.

Cold washed over Theron like ice water, making him shiver despite his efforts at stillness. He'd read about such things—anchors for demonic consciousness, allowing them to manifest partially in the material plane. It shouldn't be possible without a full ritual circle, without sacrifices, without—

The witch surveyed the room, those burning eyes sweeping across every surface. Her gaze passed over the illusory spellbook, the undisturbed cabinet, the empty shadows where they hid. Theron could feel her attention like a physical weight, pressing against his skin, searching.

Theron held his breath until his lungs burned. Didn't blink, eyes going dry and stinging. Didn't move, muscles locked, cramping.

*One chance. If she sees through the illusion—*

She frowned, perfect face creasing.

"Nothing," she murmured, her voice layered with that same fractured resonance Theron remembered from the dungeon—multiple voices speaking in unison, human and not. "The wards triggered, but nothing is disturbed..." Her head tilted, listening to something they couldn't hear.

One of the cultists shifted nervously, robes rustling. "Perhaps a malfunction, Mistress? The storm—"

"My wards do not *malfunction*." The words were sharp, cutting, carrying the threat of violence.

But uncertainty flickered across her face, a crack in the mask. She stepped further into the room, boots clicking on stone, moving toward the pedestal. Toward the illusion of his spellbook. Her hand extended, pale fingers reaching.

*Closer. Just a little closer.*

Lightning flashed outside, brilliant white, illuminating the entire room for a split second. Thunder followed immediately, rattling the windows in their frames, shaking dust from the ceiling.

Her hand reached out—long fingers with nails filed to points, scarred with ritual marks—inches from the illusory book—

**Now.**

Theron released the breath he'd been holding, lungs aching, and let the magic *surge* through him like a flood breaking a dam.

---

# Chapter 10: The Battle

"Execute—NOW!"

His hand thrust forward, the bat guano and sulfur igniting between his fingers with a burst of heat that seared his palm. The incantation tore from his throat, raw and primal, every syllable burning. A bead of orange light streaked across the room, leaving tracers in his vision, the air hissing—

And *bloomed* like a second sun.

---

**FIREBALL**

**damage.**

---

The study *exploded* in flame and fury and brilliant orange light.

The heat hit first—a wall of searing air that flash-burned exposed skin, that made lungs gasp and eyes water. Books ignited instantly, pages curling black, centuries of knowledge consumed in seconds. Alchemical vials shattered in the heat and added their contents to the inferno—green flames mixing with orange, chemicals hissing and popping. The smell was overwhelming—burning paper and leather, sulfur, mercury vapor, cooked flesh. The cultists screamed—high and shrill and inhuman—as their robes caught fire, as flesh blistered and blackened and peeled. The shockwave hurled them backward like ragdolls, robes streaming fire. One slammed into the wall with a wet crunch and didn't rise, skull cracking against stone. The other staggered, burning like a living torch, flailing blindly, still screaming, the sound cutting through the roar of flames.

The witch shrieked—not in pain, but in *rage*, voice cracking with fury. The flames licked at her robes, her hair, making her glow like something from hell, but she was warded against fire. Of course she was. Centuries of paranoia made manifest in protective enchantments.

But she was *distracted*, her concentration broken, her certainty shattered.

The illusion shattered. She saw the empty pedestal now, understood the deception, and her black-and-starfire eyes snapped toward his position—

"*You!*" Her voice cracked like thunder. "The escaped rat. The *clever little prisoner*." She laughed, wild and sharp. "Did you think I wouldn't find you? That you could hide in *shadows* from me?"

Her hands rose, dark energy already gathering.

Too late.

---

## Sera and Tomren Move

Sera's shoulders rolled once—a fighter's reflex—before she exploded from the shadows like a vengeful spirit. Her blade caught the burning cultist across the throat—a clean strike, precise, lethal. He dropped without a sound.

Tomren's crossbow *thunked*. The bolt took the fallen cultist through the chest, ensuring he wouldn't rise again.

"Both targets eliminated," Tomren called out, already reloading. "Area secure for now."

---

## The Hollow Shape

The entity-shadow twisted toward him with impossible geometry, its hollow form rippling with wrongness that hurt to perceive. It didn't burn—fire passed *through* it like light through water, finding nothing solid to consume, the flames distorting around its edges. It opened what might be a mouth, a tear in reality itself, and a sound emerged—not heard but *felt*, vibrating through bone and brain, a frequency that made his teeth ache and his skull throb and his thoughts scatter like leaves in wind. The sensation was *wrong*, invasive, like cold fingers reaching inside his mind and pulling things apart.

*It was trying to unmake his concentration. To unmake* him.

*Theron held. Barely.*

His vision blurred at the edges, colors bleeding together, walls seeming to breathe and flex, reality trying to fray like old fabric. But he *anchored* himself with desperate force. His hand found his component pouch, fingers pressing against the familiar leather hard enough to bruise. The spellbook against his chest, solid and real and his. Whisper's claws in his shoulder, tiny pinpoints of grounding pain. The heat of flames on his face, real and burning and alive.

*He was real. He was there. He would not be erased. He would not.*

---

Theron pivoted toward the herald fragment, the words of *Dispel Magic* already forming—but no. That wasn't enough. This thing wasn't a spell to be dispelled. It was an *intrusion*.

Theron needed **Banishment**.

His thumb traced across his fingertips, each touch marking a syllable, grounding the complex weaving. The incantation rose, his voice cutting through the roar of flames and the witch's screaming fury. His hand traced the sigil in the air—a doorway, but reversed. Not summoning. *Expelling*.

"By the boundaries between worlds, by the laws that separate what is from what should not be—"


---

*The herald fragment SHRIEKS.*

Not sound—*anti-sound*. A void where noise should be, silence so complete and wrong it felt like pressure inside his skull, like his ears were bleeding though they weren't. It thrashed, its hollow form collapsing inward like a dying star, edges fraying and burning like paper caught in invisible flame.

A rift opened behind it—not to another plane, but to *nowhere*. The space between spaces, a tear in the fabric of everything. Cold poured through, not temperature but the *absence* of warmth, of light, of hope. The herald was *pulled*, stretched like taffy, its shadowy form elongating and distorting as reality reasserted itself, forcing it out like an infection expelled.

For one heartbeat—eternal and instant—he saw something *beyond* it. A vastness that made the ocean look like a puddle, that made mountains look like grains of sand. An eye that wasn't an eye, a presence that was awareness without form, ancient beyond comprehension. The weight of Szeth-Kaan's attention pressed against the membrane of the world, and Theron felt it looking *at* him, *through* him, *into* him.

*It saw him.* Knew him. Tasted his soul.

*It would remember.*

Then the rift snapped shut with a sound like reality healing itself, and the herald was *gone*, and Theron was gasping, shaking, blood dripping from his nose though he didn't remember it starting.

---

## The Witch Alone

"*NO!*"

The witch's scream was raw. Desperate. For a moment, the ancient mask slipped and Theron saw something almost *human*—centuries of work, of bargains, of sacrifices, torn away in seconds.

"Two hundred years," she gasped, staring at the space where the herald vanished. "Two hundred years I cultivated that connection. Feeding it. Binding it. Promising it..." Her eyes snapped to him, and the humanity vanished, replaced by something colder than winter. "You dare. You *dare* undo my work?"

The flames were dying now, smothered by her will, but the damage was done. Her study was ruined. Her cultists were dead. Her connection to Szeth-Kaan had been *severed*—at least temporarily.

She stood alone in the wreckage, white hair singed, black eyes blazing with millennia of accumulated hatred.

"You," she said, voice singular now—no longer layered with the herald's whispers, no longer fractured by ancient power. Just *her*. Morganna. The girl who once held wildflowers, now holding only rage. "The prisoner who escaped. The thief who stole my familiar."

Her gaze found Whisper on his shoulder, and something ancient and wounded flickered across her face.

"Traitor," she hissed. "Forty years of service, and you betray me for *this*?" She gestured dismissively at Theron. "For another desperate fool chasing ghosts?"

"Survivor," Whisper corrected softly. "And he's no fool. He's—"

"I know what he is." Her eyes narrowed, studying Theron's face with sudden intensity. "I know that *look*. The grief. The determination." A cold smile. "Tell me, wizard—what did you lose? A lover? A child? They all come here seeking something. And they all end the same way."

Theron's jaw tightened. She didn't remember. Lucian was just one victim among dozens, maybe hundreds. A footnote in her journal. Disposable.

"Let me clarify," he said, voice cold and precise. "My name is Theron Ashborne."

Something flickered in her expression. Recognition? No—just calculation. Weighing whether the name meant anything, whether she should *remember*.

"Ashborne." She tasted the name, then dismissed it. "Means nothing. You're all the same in the end. Ambitious. Arrogant. Thinking you can challenge *me*." She raised her hands, dark energy crackling between her fingers. "I've killed paladins. Witch hunters. Master wizards with twice your experience. What makes you think you're *special*?"

"Let me think... special? No." Theron's voice carried academic precision, each word carefully chosen. "But I am willing to die here if it means no one else has to. No more sons. No more daughters. No more families like mine, like Sera's, like all the others you've destroyed." He met her eyes. "You sacrifice others to preserve yourself. I'll sacrifice myself to stop you. That's the difference between us."

The witch laughed—a sound like breaking glass. But there was something uncertain in it now. "Noble. Stupid. They always *say* that. But when death comes, they all beg—"

"Then you'll see," Theron said, his academic tone unwavering even in the face of death. "When that moment comes for me."

She was weakened—he could see it, feel it—but she was far from helpless. Centuries of power didn't evaporate because he burned her library and banished her patron.

But she was alone now. No cultists. No herald. No Szeth-Kaan whispering in her ear.

Just a witch, a wizard, and a reckoning.

---

**Combat Status:**

- **Cultists:** DEAD
- **Herald Fragment:** BANISHED (Szeth-Kaan's connection temporarily severed)
- **The Witch:** Wounded, weakened, *furious*
- **Your Party:** Unharmed (so far)

**Sera** readied her blade, circling left. Her fingers brushed the locket at her throat—once, quick—before she adjusted her sword grip.

**Tomren** positioned himself at Sera's back, crossbow aimed at the witch's heart. Click-click-click—adjusting the tension, preparing.

**Whisper** hissed from his shoulder: "End it now. Before she recovers. Before she summons something worse."

---

*Theron read the rhythm of her casting like sheet music—the gathering darkness, the hungry void forming between her fingers. He knew this spell. He'd seen it in forbidden texts, warned students against it.*

*Soul Siphon. If it hit, it didn't just kill. It* consumed.

His lips moved, muttering counter-incantation fragments under his breath, preparing.

"This is how it ends for all of you," the witch said, almost conversationally, as the darkness coalesced in her palm. "Fighting. Struggling. Thinking you matter. But you're just *fuel*. Just another—"

"Let me think... no." Theron's voice was steady, analytical even now. "Your casting pattern—I recognize it from the forbidden texts. Soul Siphon, if I'm correct. Not today, witch."

---

Theron snapped his hand up, the counter-incantation spilling from his lips like water dousing flame. His magic crashed into hers at the moment of release—

---

*The Soul Siphon inverted.*

"No—" Her eyes widened, pupils dilating in sudden fear. "*No*—you can't—"

But he could. And he did.

The witch's own magic reversed course like a snake turning on its master, like a river flowing backward. The hungry void snapped back toward its creator with terrible inevitability, dark tendrils wrapping around her arms, her chest, her *throat*, tightening like living rope. She clawed at them, fingers passing through shadow, finding nothing to grip.

She screamed. Not rage this time. Not fury or indignation. *Pain*. Real, genuine, mortal pain—raw and visceral, the sound torn from a throat that hadn't made such sounds in centuries. The sound of someone discovering they could *hurt* again, that they could *bleed*, that they were not invincible after all.

"*Impossible*—I perfected this—spent *decades*—" The words came in gasps, breath hitching, voice cracking. "No one has ever—"

The spell wasn't designed to be survivable from the inside. It tore at her essence like hooks in flesh, feeding on the very power she poured into it, consuming her from within. Black veins spidered across her pale skin, spreading from her heart outward like cracks in porcelain, the ritualistic patterns glowing sickly green and pulsing with each labored heartbeat. Her knees buckled, joints failing, and she made a sound—half-gasp, half-sob—that might have been mortal once.

"You're... you're just a *child*," she gasped, disbelief warring with agony. "A hedge wizard. I've walked this earth for *three hundred years*—"

She dropped.

For the first time in centuries, Morganna the Witch of Thornhollow was on her knees before someone.
---

Tomren took one deep breath, went perfectly still, then loosed. The bolt streaked toward the witch but she twisted, weakened but not helpless, and it grazed her shoulder instead of her heart.

Theron didn't hesitate. Silver mist erupted around him, cool and ethereal against his burned skin, reality folding like paper, space bending and *stepping*—

—emerging three feet from her crumpled form, boots solidifying on stone, close enough to see the black tears leaking from her starfire eyes, thick and viscous like oil. Close enough to smell centuries of dark magic rotting from within—ozone and old blood and something sweeter underneath, like fruit left too long to ferment, like decay wrapped in perfume. The smell made his stomach turn.

She looked up at him, pale face twisted. Hatred blazing in those wrong eyes. Fear—real fear, perhaps for the first time in centuries. Something that might almost be *respect*.

"Clever... little... mage..." A bloody smile, black ichor coating her teeth. "You remind me of someone. That boy—eight years ago? Dark hair, clever eyes. He had your same..." She coughed, black blood spraying from her lips, spattering the stone between them. "...your same determination. Before I—"

"Let me clarify precisely." Theron's voice was ice-cold, his precision sharpening under the weight of emotion. "His name was Lucian Ashborne. My *son*."

Her expression shifted. Recognition. Then—was that *remorse*? No. Just calculation. Always calculation.

"Ah." She almost laughed. "Then this is... poetic. The father avenging the—" She tried to rise, power flickering around her fingers. "But you're too *late*, wizard. Eight years too late. And you'll never—"

Her hand twitched, reaching for another spell—

---

"No. You will not."

The words carried weight. Power. *Command*. Academic precision honed to a cutting edge, every syllable deliberate.

His hand touched his spellbook beneath his robe—one brief moment of certainty, of connection—before he spoke the incantation, each word resonating with absolute authority. His will slammed into hers like a hammer against cracked glass, shattering her defenses, forcing itself into her nervous system, seizing control.

---

*She froze.*

Every muscle locked instantly, tendons going rigid, breath catching mid-inhale. Her reaching hand stopped mid-gesture, fingers curled like claws, knuckles white, nails biting into her own palm. Her mouth hung open, mid-incantation, jaw slack, the words dying unspoken on her tongue. Only her eyes moved—darting frantically left to right, up and down, pupils contracting and dilating, furious, desperate, *terrified*.

She was paralyzed. Completely. Helplessly. Unable to move, unable to speak, unable to cast.

*At his mercy.*

And in her eyes, for just a moment, Theron saw something he didn't expect: understanding. She knew what came next. She'd been on this side of the exchange dozens of times. Hundreds. Had stood over paralyzed victims, had seen this exact terror reflected in their eyes before she ended them.

But never on *this* side. Never helpless. Never the prey.

# Chapter 11: Stolen Years

**The Room Falls Silent**

The flames had died to embers. Smoke curled toward the ceiling. The ruined study smoldered around them—centuries of accumulated knowledge reduced to ash and char.

Sera approached slowly, blade still raised, staring at the frozen witch with something between wonder and horror.

"Target status? Is this finished?"

"Almost."

Tomren kept his crossbow trained on her heart. "We could finish this right now. One bolt through the skull would end it."

Whisper crawled down his arm, perching on his wrist, staring at his former master with ancient, unreadable eyes.

"She's bound to Szeth-Kaan," he said quietly. "Killing her might release the binding—or it might *complete* the sacrifice. The entity wanted an ending. A bloodline erased. If she dies with the connection still partially intact..."

"Millhaven vanishes anyway," he finished.

"Possibly. I don't know. No one's ever gotten this far."

---

*The witch's eyes rolled toward him. Pleading? Threatening? It was impossible to tell.*

Theron had her. The most dangerous creature in the valley, frozen at his feet like a statue. Her power was his to claim—or destroy.

But the binding to Szeth-Kaan still lingered. Weakened, yes. Severed temporarily, yes. But not *broken*. The entity still waited beyond the veil, patient as entropy, watching through whatever cracks remained.

---

His right hand moved unconsciously—thumb rubbing across his fingertips in the old pattern. Index. Middle. Ring. Pinky. The gesture he'd developed years ago when faced with impossible choices. Each finger a point of consideration. Each touch a weighing of consequences.

"Stand back," he said quietly. "All of you."

Sera hesitated. "Your intent?"

"Something dangerous. Something necessary." He met her eyes. "If this goes wrong, take Whisper. Find Elina. Extract immediately. No looking back."

"Wizard—"

His fingers found his component pouch, checking its weight by habit. Nearly empty now—most of his reagents spent in the battle above. But enough remained. Always enough for one more spell.

"*Promise me.*"

A long pause. Then she nodded, stepping back, pulling Tomren with her.

Tomren clicked his crossbow's tension mechanism once—a quiet ratchet of sound that spoke of readiness. He positioned himself three steps back, angled to cover Theron without blocking Sera's line of sight. No wasted movement. No hesitation. Just the hunter's instinct, placing himself where he could protect what mattered.

Whisper remained on his wrist, trembling.

"You don't have to do this," he whispered. "There might be another way—"

"Let me think... No. The temporal constraints are absolute. Szeth-Kaan is watching. Waiting. Every second we delay, the binding reknits itself." He looked down at the frozen witch, her terrified eyes locked on his. "She spent centuries accumulating power. Stealing it. Hoarding it. Now it goes to someone who'll actually *use* it for something other than fear."

Theron knelt beside her.

"This is going to hurt. Both of us."

---

He'd read about this. Theoretical texts, forbidden grimoires, warnings scrawled in margins by wizards who attempted it and *failed*. Life force transference. Essence absorption. The magical equivalent of drinking the ocean through a straw.

Most who try are consumed by what they take. The foreign magic overwhelms them, rewrites them, leaves nothing but a hollow shell wearing their face.

But he wasn't most wizards.

Theron drew the gnarled oak wand from his belt—Maren's gift, crude but functional, the rough bark pressing into his palm. He held it in his right hand, letting it ground the wild magic that was about to flow through him, knuckles white with tension. His left hand pressed against the witch's temple, her skin cold and waxy beneath his fingertips, like touching a corpse.

The spellbook at his chest thrummed, vibrating against his ribs like a second heartbeat. The cracked crystal pendant pulsed against his sternum, its unstable resonance humming in anticipation, growing warmer with each beat, almost hot now.

*Warning or encouragement—he couldn't tell.*

His breath came shallow. His heart raced. Sweat dripped down his temple despite the cold.

Theron closed his eyes.

And he *reached* into her mind, into her essence, into three hundred years of stolen life.

---

*Contact.*

---

Her mind crashed into his like a tidal wave, like being hit by a wall of water and stone and centuries of accumulated grief and rage.

*Centuries* of memory slammed into him all at once, overwhelming every sense, drowning thought in sensation—

---

*A child. Ten years old. Braids. Wildflowers clutched in small hands. She was smiling at something beyond the frame, innocent, untouched. The cottage behind her was modest but loved.*

*Then: darkness. Laughter echoing in barn rafters. Friends? No—tormentors. "Weak little Morganna, can't even light a candle." Flames rising—not from her hands. From theirs. Magic she didn't have, used to humiliate. A prank. Just a prank. But the fire caught on dry straw, spread faster than breathing, *engulfed*—*

*Screaming. Her screaming, high and shrill and terrified. Burning. The heat beyond anything imaginable, skin blistering and blackening and peeling, hair igniting like straw, the smell of her own flesh cooking—sweet and horrible, making her gag even as she shrieked. Pain everywhere, consuming, absolute, no thought beyond make it stop make it STOP—*

*Voices in the darkness. Not human. Older. "We can save you, child. But you must give us something in return." She was dying. She agreed. She didn't understand what she was agreeing to.*

*The change. The hunger. The voices wouldn't stop now. They whispered constantly. They wanted. They taught. She learned.*

*Seven figures. Her former friends. Bound in a circle. She was fourteen now, scarred, *different*. They begged. Pleaded. "It was just a joke, Morganna, we didn't mean—" The flames rose. Not an accident this time. Her flames. Deliberate. Righteous. The voices sang approval as her friends burned.*

*The first taste of stolen life. The rush of power. The addiction.*

*Centuries blur—*

---

*Then: a young man. Eager. Brilliant. Dark hair, sharp eyes, carrying translations of Old Texts.*

*"My name is Lucian Ashborne. I've come seeking knowledge."*

*She smiled. They always came willingly.*

---

Theron's eyes snapped open—still in contact, still draining, but *aware* now.

"*You.*" The word came out strangled. "Lucian. You killed my *son*."

Her frozen eyes widened. *Recognition. Understanding. Fear.*

The memories continued—her memories now filtered through his rage—

*Lucian in the ritual circle, drawn in blood and silver. Midnight, new moon. The binding incantations spoken in voices that shouldn't exist. Szeth-Kaan's attention turning toward him like a searchlight of annihilation, focusing, pressing, *judging*. The boy's magical lineage insufficient—she could taste it in his blood, smell it in his essence. Not enough generations. Too raw. Too new.*

*The connection collapsing like a bridge snapping. Lucian convulsing, every muscle seizing, spine arching, fingers clawing at nothing. Blood pouring from his nose in streams, from his eyes like tears, from his ears. His mouth open, screaming, voice breaking: "Father, I'm sorry—Father, I'm—" And then nothing. Just vacant eyes and slack jaw and the smell of voided bowels and death.*

*His death. Cold. Meaningless. His body dragged by thralls. His disposal—dumped like trash in the oubliette, fourth level, bones landing on bones. The sound echoing up the shaft.*

*The journal entry, written an hour later while drinking wine: "Wonder if anyone will come looking for him. They never do."*

---

"*I came.*"

Theron's grip tightened on her temples. The draining intensified—no longer careful, no longer measured. *Rage* fueled it now.

"Eight years I searched. Eight years I *hoped*. And you threw him away like *refuse*."

Her power flooded into him—but now he saw *all* of it. The innocent child she was. The monster she became. The centuries of victims. The bargains. The sacrifices. Lucian was just one of dozens, maybe *hundreds*.

But he was *his*.

"This is for him," Theron whispered.

And he *pulled*.

---

*Theron held—barely.*

---

Pain. *Unimaginable* pain beyond anything he'd ever felt, beyond anything he'd imagined was possible.

Her power flooded into him like molten iron poured into a vessel too small to contain it, like liquid fire in his veins. The wand in his hand grew hot, smoking, the rough bark blackening, the wood beginning to char and split, heat searing into his palm but he couldn't let go, couldn't, needed the anchor. His veins *burned* like lines of fire traced beneath his skin, glowing faintly red through the flesh. His vision whited out, overwhelmed by light and agony and too much, too much—

The pendant at his chest flared white-hot—metal blistering the skin beneath his robe—then *shattered* with a sound like a bell breaking.

Crystal shards burst outward in a spray, cutting through his robes like tiny knives, embedding in his chest, his neck, his jaw. Blood ran hot down his skin. But the pendant's death bought him precious seconds—its final resonance helping channel the overwhelming flood of power just long enough for him to anchor it, to force it into the vessel of himself without being consumed.

Somewhere far away—or maybe right here, he couldn't tell anymore—he heard himself screaming. Raw. Hoarse. Inhuman.

And beneath the pain—*guilt*.

*I'm killing her. Not in battle. Not in self-defense. I'm draining the life from a helpless woman.*

The thought rose unbidden. She was frozen. Terrified. At his mercy. And he was *taking* from her the same way she took from others.

*Does that make me like her?*

His thumb moved against his fingers again. Index. Middle. Ring. Pinky. Each point a question with no clean answer.

No—she murdered innocents. She killed Lucian. She was responsible for decades of suffering.

But he was still taking a life. Deliberately. Coldly.

*Is this justice? Or is this revenge?*

He didn't know. He wasn't sure the distinction mattered anymore.

But he didn't let go.

Theron *pulled*.

---

---

*I am not her. I am not her. I am NOT her.*

The mantra became an anchor—both rejection and plea. Her memories tried to merge with his—her hatreds becoming his hatreds, her fears becoming his fears, her *hunger* seeping into his bones like poison.

For a terrible moment, he understood her. The power. The rush. The intoxicating certainty that *might makes right*.

*No.*

He rejected it. Violently. Pushed back against the seduction of easy answers and stolen strength.

He took the power but left the poison. The magic but not the madness. The essence but not the corruption.

It was the hardest thing he'd ever done.

Harder than escaping the dungeon. Harder than surviving the river. Harder than standing against an entity that erases existence itself.

Because part of him—a small, dark part he didn't know existed—*wanted* to let it in. Wanted to become what she was. Powerful. Feared. *Untouchable*.

*No.*

He held the line between justice and vengeance. Between wizard and monster.

*Barely.*

But he did it.

---

Theron felt the moment it snapped.

Szeth-Kaan's connection to the witch—that ancient, hungry thread stretching between worlds—*severed*. The entity howled across dimensions, its rage echoing through planes he couldn't perceive. It was *so close*. The sacrifice was *almost complete*.

And he stole it.

The witch convulsed beneath his hands, body jerking violently, muscles spasming. Her skin withered like paper held to flame, decades catching up in seconds, centuries of stolen youth fleeing all at once. Wrinkles carved deep into her face, spreading like cracks in porcelain. Her white hair turned brittle as straw, fell away in clumps that dissolved before hitting the ground, carried on wind that wasn't there. Her black-and-starfire eyes faded to milky blindness, the pupils burning out like dying coals until only white remained, then nothing.

She aged. Crumbled. *Ended*.

Not erased—not forgotten—just... finished. A natural death, centuries overdue, finally catching up.

Her body collapsed inward, flesh desiccating, bones turning brittle and hollow. Skin flaked away like ash. In seconds, there was nothing left but a pile of grey dust and the smell of old parchment.

When it was over, only dust remained. And silence.

---

## The Aftermath

Theron collapsed backward, legs giving out, hitting the stone floor hard. Gasping. Trembling. *Alive*.

His body felt like it had been struck by lightning and drowned in ice simultaneously, torn apart and stitched back together wrong. Every nerve screamed in protest. Every muscle spasmed, twitching uncontrollably. His hands shook so badly he couldn't control them. Blood ran from his nose, his ears, the cuts from the pendant shards. His vision swam. His breath came in ragged gasps. But beneath the pain, cutting through the agony like a blade of light, he felt something else.

*Power.* Raw and vast and newly his.

Not hers—not the twisted, hungry magic she accumulated through theft and murder. That he rejected. But the *essence* of what she was—the raw potential, the arcane foundation—that he kept. Refined. Made his own.

**He had absorbed the witch's life force.**

**Level Up.**

His spellcasting felt *sharper*. His connection to the arcane *deeper*. Spells that once required concentration now flowed like breathing. His capacity had *expanded*.

---

Sera was at his side, hauling him upright. Her face was pale, shaken. She rolled her shoulders once—settling weight that wasn't there, a soldier's habit after witnessing something that defied clean categorization.

"You were screaming," she said. "Fifty-two seconds. We thought—"

"I'm okay." He wasn't sure if it was true, but he said it anyway. "I'm okay."

Tomren stared at the pile of dust that was once the Witch of Thornhollow.

"The witch. Is she truly gone?"

"Gone. Truly gone." Whisper's voice was strange—quiet, almost *grieving*. He hopped from Theron's wrist to the floor, approaching the dust, sniffing it once. "Forty years I served her. Hated her. Feared her. And now..."

He was silent for a long moment.

"Now I'm free."

---

**Status Update:**

- **The Witch:** DESTROYED (absorbed, not killed—Szeth-Kaan's binding broken cleanly)
- **Szeth-Kaan:** BANISHED (connection severed; the entity retreats beyond the veil, denied its sacrifice)
- **Millhaven:** SAVED (the village will wake tomorrow, unaware of how close they came to oblivion)
- **Your Party:** Alive, battered, victorious
- **You:** LEVELED UP — new spells available, enhanced capacity, but deeply exhausted

---

Sera gripped his shoulder.

"Elina. Primary objective remains. We need to locate and extract her." Her free hand moved to the locket at her throat, fingers closing around the silver oval. Six months of searching. Six months of carrying this weight. Almost over now.

Theron nodded, forcing himself to stand on shaking legs.

"The tower. That's the most logical location for high-value prisoners. Whisper—can you confirm and guide us?"

The familiar looked up from his former master's remains. Something had changed in his eyes. Something *softer*.

"Yes. I can." He climbed back to Theron's shoulder. "Let's finish this."

---

"Give me thirty seconds to search for supplies," he said, already scanning the wreckage.

---

---

The flames had consumed much, but not everything. The witch had been paranoid—*redundantly* paranoid. Hidden compartments within hidden compartments.

His fingers found a loose stone behind where the cabinet had stood. He pried it free, revealing a small alcove untouched by fire. Inside:

**Three vials**, each glowing faintly with inner light.

- **Crimson vial** — warmth radiates from the glass; the liquid swirls like contained fire
- **Azure vial** — cool to the touch, smelling faintly of mountain air and rain
- **Golden vial** — thick, honey-like, humming with raw magical resonance

Whisper sniffed each one from his shoulder.

"Crimson is a *Potion of Vitality*—purges exhaustion, restores stamina. The azure is a *Potion of Healing*, superior grade. And the golden..." He paused, whiskers twitching. "That's rare. *Elixir of Arcane Restoration*. Replenishes spent spell slots. She must have been saving it for emergencies."

*An emergency like being drained by an upstart wizard, perhaps.*

---

He pocketed the azure and golden vials for later, but drank the crimson one immediately, uncorking it with shaking hands and tilting it back. The liquid was warm, almost hot, tasting of cinnamon and copper and something indefinably magical.

The effect was instantaneous.

Warmth flooded through him—not the burning pain of absorbed power, but something *healing*, like sunlight after days of cold. His muscles unknotted, tension draining away like water. His vision sharpened, the blurriness fading, colors becoming crisp again. The bone-deep exhaustion receded like tide pulling back from shore, leaving him gasping with relief. The cuts from the pendant shards closed, skin knitting together with faint tingles. The trembling in his hands stopped.

He wasn't at full strength. Not truly. But he was *functional*. Battle-ready. Alive.

**Exhaustion cleared. Stamina restored.**

---

Theron also spotted, half-buried beneath a collapsed shelf:

- **A leather journal** — the witch's personal notes, singed but legible
- **A ring of iron keys** — including one that pulsed faintly with enchantment

Theron grabbed all three. The journal alone could contain centuries of research—dark, yes, but *knowledge*. The keys would open whatever cells held Elina and any other prisoners. The scrolls...

*Later. Rescue now.*

---

**Inventory Updated:**

- Potion of Healing (Superior) — saved
- Elixir of Arcane Restoration — saved
- Witch's Journal — acquired
- Ring of Keys (including enchanted key) — acquired
- Sealed Scroll Case — acquired

---

Theron turned to his companions.

"Status: operational. We can proceed."

Sera's eyes flickered with desperate hope. Tomren checked his crossbow one final time. Whisper settled against his neck, a warm and steady presence.

---

**The Tower**

Theron moved through the castle's corridors with new confidence. The witch's servants—those few that remained—*felt* her absence. He passed two cultists fleeing toward the main gates, robes abandoned, faces pale with terror. They didn't even look at him.

The tower staircase spiraled upward, torchlight flickering against ancient stone. Their footsteps echoed in the narrow space. Sera took the lead now, sword drawn, maternal fury propelling her upward. Her hand found the locket again as she climbed—one touch, then another, like counting heartbeats. *Still here. Still looking. Almost there.*

---

**The Tower Prison**

The door at the top was iron-banded oak, locked with three separate mechanisms. He pulled out the ring of keys, trying each until—

*Click. Click. Click.*

The door swung open.

---

The room beyond was circular, ringed with cells—six in total, iron bars corroded with age but still sturdy. The air smelled of straw and despair and something faintly *chemical*. Herbs. Incense. Blood.

Four cells were empty.

One held a man—middle-aged, emaciated, staring at nothing with hollow eyes. He didn't react to their presence.

And the last...

"*Elina!*"

---

Sera rushed forward, falling to her knees before the bars. Her fingers went immediately to the locket, pressing it hard against her chest as if the portrait inside could somehow reach through the metal to touch the living girl beyond.

The cell was small. Maybe eight feet by eight. A thin pallet of straw. A wooden bucket. Nothing else.

On the pallet, curled into herself like a child trying to disappear, trying to take up as little space as possible, was a young woman.

Theron recognized her from the locket portrait—the sharp features, the dark eyes—but six months had left their mark. She was gaunt, skin stretched tight over bone, cheekbones too prominent, hollows at her temples, collarbones jutting beneath a torn shift that might have once been white but was now grey with grime and old bloodstains. Her dark hair hung in tangled mats past her shoulders, greasy and unwashed, clumped together. Her skin was pale, the color of someone who hadn't seen sun in months, marked with bruises in various stages of healing—purple, yellow, green.

But it was the *marks* that made his stomach turn.

Ritual symbols. Painted on her arms in faded ink that had seeped into her skin—circles within circles, geometric patterns that writhed at the edge of his vision, making his eyes hurt to look at directly. Preparation marks. The witch had been *preparing* her for something. Making her *ready*. Some of the symbols were carved into her skin, raised scars forming the patterns.

Her wrists bore rope burns—old ones, partially healed but still angry red, the skin rubbed raw repeatedly. She had been restrained. Often. For long periods.

There were deep hollows under her eyes—not just from malnutrition, but from *sleeplessness*. From fear. From six months of not knowing if each day would be her last, each footstep in the corridor the one that would take her to the ritual chamber.

She didn't move when they entered. Didn't react to Sera's cry. She just stared at the far wall with empty eyes, knees drawn up to her chest, arms wrapped around them, rocking slightly—forward and back, forward and back, a rhythmic motion that suggested hours of this, days, weeks.

*Broken,* Theron thought. *Or close to it.* The dissociation of someone who'd learned that being present hurt too much.

---

"Elina." Sera's voice broke on the name. "It's me. It's your mother."

Nothing. The rocking continued. A soft humming—tuneless, mechanical, a coping mechanism.

Sera's hands gripped the bars so hard her knuckles went white. One hand released, touching the locket again—desperate now, as if the small silver weight could anchor her against the fear that she was too late. "Elina. Look at me. Please."

For a long moment, nothing happened.

Then—slowly, as if waking from a deep sleep—Elina's head turned.

Her eyes focused on Sera's face slowly, like someone waking from a deep sleep. Confusion flickering across her hollow features. Disbelief. Her cracked lips parted. Then—

*Recognition.*

"...Mama?"

The word was a whisper. Hoarse. Raw. The voice of someone who hadn't spoken in days. Maybe weeks. The voice of someone who'd screamed until they had no voice left, then learned silence was safer.

"I'm here." Tears streamed down Sera's scarred face—hot and sudden and unstoppable—the soldier's iron composure shattering completely, crumbling like the witch had crumbled. "I'm here. I located you. Extracting you now." Her voice broke on the last word, barely able to form speech through the tears.

Elina blinked. Once. Twice. As if trying to determine if this was real or just another dream conjured by a starving mind, another hallucination brought on by hunger and fear and hope that hurt too much to hold onto.

"You... came?" Her voice trembled, cracked, barely audible. "I thought... she said you wouldn't. She said no one would. She said—" A sob broke through. "She said I was forgotten. That you'd moved on. That no one was looking anymore—"

"Six months of searching. Every day. Every night." Sera's voice was fierce through the tears, rough with emotion held back for too long. Her hand closed around the locket one final time—squeezing hard enough to hurt, feeling the metal bite into her palm—then released it. She didn't need it anymore. The girl in the portrait was right here. Real. Alive. Breathing. "Never stopped. Never gave up. Not once."

Something broke in Elina's expression. The walls she had built to survive—the dissociation, the numbness, the deliberate *absence*, the protective shell around what little was left—cracked like ice under pressure.

And she *sobbed*. Deep, wrenching sounds torn from somewhere deep in her chest, six months of held-back grief and terror and despair pouring out all at once. Her body shook with it, gasping for air between sobs.

---

Theron stepped forward quickly, pulling out the ring of keys. His own eyes stung. The enchanted one pulsed as he approached Elina's cell—*this one, it said, use me*—and he slid it into the lock with shaking hands. Under his breath, fragments of an unlocking cantrip rose unbidden—"*claudere... aperire... liberare*"—old words, unnecessary for a physical key, but the habit ran deep.

*Click.*

The sound echoed in the stone chamber.

The door swung open.

---

Sera crossed the distance in a heartbeat, falling to her knees beside the pallet, joints hitting stone hard enough to bruise. She reached for her daughter—then hesitated, hands hovering, seeing the marks, the bruises, the carved symbols, the *damage*. Fear in her eyes. *What if I hurt her? What if touch is pain now?*

"Can I—may I touch you?" Her voice was gentle, asking permission, giving control back.

Elina nodded, still crying, unable to speak, just a quick jerk of her head.

Sera gathered her daughter into her arms—gently, carefully, as if she might shatter like glass, like holding something infinitely precious and infinitely fragile. Her hands trembled as she wrapped them around Elina's thin frame, feeling bones too prominent through the shift. Elina clung to her, fingers digging into her mother's armor, face buried in her mother's shoulder, making sounds that weren't quite words—half-sobs, half-gasps, raw animal sounds of pain and relief intertwined. Six months of held-back grief pouring out all at once, soaking into Sera's shoulder.

"I've got you," Sera whispered, rocking her slowly, one hand cradling her daughter's head, the other wrapped around her back. "Secured. Safe now. No one's hurting you again. That's a promise. That's a *promise*." Tears streamed down her face, dripping into Elina's tangled hair.

"She was going to—" Elina gasped between sobs. "—use me for something. A ritual. She kept saying my blood was *right*. That I had what she needed. She kept *marking* me, preparing—"

"It's over. Threat neutralized. She's dead. She can't hurt you anymore."

"Dead?" Elina pulled back slightly, searching her mother's face. "Truly?"

"Confirmed kill. Permanent." Sera looked at Theron. "Thanks to him."

Elina's red-rimmed eyes found him. She stared for a moment—taking in the robes, the spellbook, the residual power crackling around him like St. Elmo's fire.

"Another wizard," she said flatly. Fear flickered across her face.

"Negative. Different classification entirely. He assisted the rescue operation. He's the reason we succeeded."

Theron knelt so he was at her eye level. "My name is Theron. You're safe now. I promise."

Elina studied him with eyes far older than sixteen. "Wizards don't make promises. They make bargains."

*Smart girl,* Whisper observed from his shoulder. *Traumatized, but not broken. She'll survive this.*

"Let me think... Then I'll propose a bargain," Theron said quietly. "The terms are as follows: you walk out of here alive and free, and in return..." He paused. "In return, you survive. You heal. You prove that what she tried to do to you didn't work. That's my price."

Elina blinked. Then, despite everything—despite the marks and the fear and the six months in a cell—a ghost of a smile touched her lips.

"Deal."

---

Tomren appeared in the doorway, carrying a cloak and a waterskin. His gruff expression was suspiciously soft. His stillness spoke volumes—the hunter's awareness that some moments demanded absolute quiet, that movement could shatter fragile things. He cleared his throat.

"Brought supplies. She'll need warmth and water."

Sera wrapped the cloak around Elina's shoulders—warm wool, hiding the marks, the torn shift, the visible damage. Elina drank from the waterskin like someone dying of thirst, then stopped herself, gasping.

"Easy. Slow sips. Your stomach needs time to adjust."

Elina nodded, understanding. She took another small sip, then lowered the skin.

"There are others," she said, voice still hoarse but stronger now. "Not here—in the village. The ones she *turned*. Thralls. They were people once. Farmers. Travelers." She met Theron's eyes. "Can you save them too?"

Theron thought of the jerking, hollow-eyed servants. The ones who tracked by scent, who didn't feel pain, who served without will.

"The thrall condition depends on several variables—duration of transformation, degree of neural degradation, residual connection to the controlling entity. I don't know if reversal is possible," he admitted. "But I'm going to try."

---

Sera helped Elina stand. The girl swayed—six months of minimal movement, minimal food—but she *stood*. Her mother supported her weight without complaint. She adjusted her sword belt with her free hand—a tactical reflex, making sure the blade wouldn't interfere with Elina's movement.

"Mobility assessment. Can you walk?"

"I... I think so. Just slowly."

Tomren shifted to Elina's other side, offering his arm. His positioning was precise—angled to bear weight without restricting mobility, close enough to catch her if she fell. Together, they created a human scaffold—keeping her upright, keeping her moving.

Whisper watched from Theron's shoulder in silence. Through their bond, Theron felt something from the familiar—not quite sadness, not quite joy. Something older. *Recognition.*

*This is what freedom looks like,* the rat whispered. *Hard-won. Painful. But real.*

---

Theron moved to the other occupied cell. The hollow-eyed man didn't respond to the keys, to his voice, to his touch on his shoulder.

"He's been here longer," Whisper said quietly. "Years, maybe. She used him for... experiments. There may not be much left."

"We're extracting all prisoners. No one gets left behind."

Theron hauled the man to his feet. He stood, barely, swaying like a reed in wind. But he *stood*.

---

**Prisoners Rescued:**

- **Elina** — malnourished but coherent; reunited with Sera
- **Unknown Man** — catatonic but ambulatory; requires care

---

As they prepared to descend, Elina spoke—her voice thin, but with an undercurrent of steel that reminded him of her mother.

"There are others. Not here—in the village. The ones she *turned*. Thralls. They were people once. Farmers. Travelers." She met his eyes. "Can you save them too?"

Theron thought of the jerking, hollow-eyed servants. The ones who tracked by scent, who didn't feel pain, who served without will.

"Let me think... The variables are complex—transformation duration, neural integrity, magical contamination. I don't know if restoration is achievable," he admitted. "But I'm going to attempt it."

---

**The Descent**

They made their way down through the castle, a strange procession—a wizard crackling with stolen power, a mother carrying her daughter, a soldier supporting a broken man, a crossbowman watching the rear, and a rat who chose freedom over fear.

The remaining cultists had fled. The thralls wandered aimlessly, their mistress's will no longer guiding them. They didn't attack—they barely *noticed* them.

---

**The Great Hall**

Theron paused here, in the cavernous chamber where the ritual had been performed. Scorch marks scarred the floor in concentric circles. The air still tasted of ozone and wrongness. But Szeth-Kaan's presence was *gone*—truly gone, banished beyond the veil.

Through the tall windows, dawn broke over the valley.

---

Sera set Elina down gently on a stone bench, wrapping her in a salvaged cloak. The girl was already looking stronger—hope did that.

"What's the next move?" Tomren asked, voicing the question everyone was thinking.

Theron looked around the great hall. At the ancient stonework. The vaulted ceilings. The windows overlooking a valley that would wake this morning unaware of how close it had come to oblivion.

He paused, considering the implications, the logistics, the sheer scope of what lay ahead. "Now we begin the reconstruction process. There's significant work to be done."

---

**Epilogue — Three Months Later**

---

The sign above the gate read:

**THORNHOLLOW INSTITUTE**
*For the Advancement of Arcane and Natural Sciences*
*All Seekers Welcome*

---

The castle had transformed.

Where once darkness festered, light now poured through cleaned windows—bright morning sunlight catching on dust motes, warming stone that had known only cold and shadow for centuries. The air smelled different—fresh bread from the kitchens, herbs drying in the greenhouse, old paper and ink from the library, woodsmoke from hearth fires. The dungeons had been converted to storage cellars and climate-controlled archives, the iron bars removed, the floors scrubbed clean of decades of stains. The ritual chamber was now a lecture hall, its scorch marks preserved as a reminder—*never forget what power can become when wielded without wisdom*. Students' voices echoed where once there had been only screams.

The study—*his* study now—had been rebuilt. New shelves, smelling of fresh-cut wood and beeswax polish, held salvaged tomes alongside fresh acquisitions. The witch's journal sat under glass, the leather binding still bearing scorch marks, available for supervised research. Scholars came from across the realm to study its contents, carefully redacted of the most dangerous knowledge.

Late at night, Theron worked at his desk by candlelight, the warm glow pooling on parchment and ink, muttering incantations under his breath as he prepared lesson materials. "*Ignis, forma, contego*"—the words came easier now, muscle memory of magic that no longer felt desperate. His component pouch sat open beside him, ingredients within easy reach, the familiar smells of sulfur and quicksilver and dried herbs mixing together. He'd reorganize it sometimes, just to feel the weight of abundance, fingers running through the pouches, checking and rechecking.

---

**The Residents:**

**Maren** arrived within a week of the witch's defeat, three wagons creaking under the weight of supplies—dried herbs bundled in sacks that filled the air with the sharp smell of thyme and sage, glass vials wrapped in straw that clinked softly with every bump, ceramic mortars and pestles packed in wool. And a sharp tongue that hadn't dulled with age.

"Someone needs to manage the medicinal wing," she said gently but firmly, white hair escaping from its practical bun as always, "and without guidance, you'd all be poisoning yourselves with mislabeled tinctures within a month."

But later, after the supplies were unloaded and the apprentices dismissed, she sat with Theron in the evening light—golden through the cleaned windows, warm on their faces—and told him the real reason. The leather journal sat between them on the table, worn and familiar.

"Thirty years," she said, voice rough with decades of grief, fingers tracing the journal's binding. "Thirty years I kept that journal, like tending a garden in the dark. Wrote down every name I could find, every person who vanished that no one else remembered. I told myself it was enough—that *remembering* was enough."

She looked at her hands, weathered and stained from years of grinding herbs and mixing tinctures, the lines deep, the knuckles swollen slightly with age. "But it wasn't. It was just... bearable. Like water wearing at stone. Lily deserved more than a name in a hidden journal. She deserved to be *avenged*."

"The witch is dead," Theron said carefully. "You have justice, at least. That has to count for something."

"I do. And it's not enough either." Maren's eyes were bright, but no tears fell—she'd cried them all out long ago. "But *this*—training healers who'll actually help people, teaching ethical magic, making sure no one else gets taken? That's not vengeance. That's not just remembering. It's like planting a tree where something was burned away."

"That's *meaning*," Theron finished softly.

She nodded. "Lily wanted to be a healer. Wanted to help people, the way water helps seeds grow. She never got the chance. But I can make sure others do. I can teach them what she would have taught." A pause. "It won't bring her back. But it makes her *matter*. Makes her loss count for something. Makes new life from old grief."

She now ran the herbalist division, training apprentices in the art of ethical potion-making and natural magic. Her sister's name was carved above the entrance to the greenhouse—*remembered at last*.

Some days Theron saw her standing there, fingers tracing the carved letters. Lips moving in silent conversation with someone who disappeared three decades ago.

**The Memorial Wall**

On the eastern courtyard wall, carved into stone, were the names. Every victim Maren could find record of—in journals, ledgers, transaction tables, and her own thirty years of careful documentation. Every person the witch's magic tried to erase from memory. The letters were deep, painstakingly carved, filled with gold leaf that caught the sunlight.

The list grew as they discovered more. Theron helped her add new ones, chiseling letters into stone with steady hands and quiet reverence, the tap-tap-tap of hammer on chisel echoing in the courtyard. Stone dust coated his fingers, settling into the grooves of his palms.

*Lily of Millhaven, Healer*
*Lucian Ashborne, Scholar*
*Elena Greytower, age 14*
*Marcus Thane, Merchant*
*The Carpenter's Daughter (name lost)*
*Brother Aldous, Monk*
*Sarah, Sarah, Sarah—three different women, three different years*

The names went on. Dozens of them. Some had families and occupations carved beneath. Some had only a first name, their surnames lost to time and enchantment. Some were marked simply: *Victim, name unknown*. But all were remembered now. All were permanent. All mattered.

Students passed it every day on their way to the greenhouses, boots scuffing on cobblestones. Visitors stopped and read, fingers tracing the carved letters, lips moving silently through the list, breath catching on names they recognized or didn't. A reminder of what happened when power corrupted without check. A promise that these deaths would not be forgotten, would not be *allowed* to be forgotten.

Theron ran his fingers over Lucian's name sometimes, feeling the carved letters beneath his touch—the grooves deep, the gold leaf smooth and warm in the sun. Real. Permanent. *Remembered.*

And below the names, in larger script, a dedication:

*"No one is forgotten. No one is alone.
This Institute stands so no more names need be carved."*

**Lucian's Memorial**

In a quiet corner of the Institute's grounds, beneath an ancient oak whose branches spread wide overhead, stood a simple memorial stone. The grass around it was always trimmed, the ground clear of fallen leaves. The inscription read:

**LUCIAN ASHBORNE**
*Scholar, Seeker, Son*
*"His curiosity lit the way for others"*

Theron visited every morning before dawn, when the grounds were empty and quiet, when dew still clung to the grass and soaked through his boots. The air smelled of earth and growing things, cool and fresh. He told Lucian about the students—their questions, their discoveries, their *caution*. He told him about Whisper's latest sarcasm, about Sera's tactical drills, about Elina's progress. His voice was quiet, hoarse with early morning, but steady.

His thumb rubbed absently against his fingers as he spoke—the old thinking gesture, softer now without the weight of immediate crisis. Just habit. Just comfort.

He never managed to recover Lucian's remains from the oubliette—the collapse during the final battle sealed it forever. But he had the book Lucian was translating, displayed in a place of honor in the library. He had Lucian's notes, preserved under glass. He had his son's handwriting, his questions, his brilliant, dangerous curiosity.

And now he taught others what Lucian never learned: that knowledge without wisdom was a blade that cut the wielder. That some doors, once opened, could not be closed. That seeking truth required knowing which truths were safe to seek.

*"I'm sorry I didn't find you in time,"* Theron whispers to the stone. *"But I promise—no one else will fall the way you did. Not here. Not while I'm watching."*

In his pocket, he carried the folded journal page. Always. His other hand checked his component pouch—*full* now, ingredients neatly organized, each compartment stocked. The weight of it was different than before. Not desperate scarcity, but careful preparation.

---

**Sera** stayed longer than she planned.

"Just until Elina recovers," she said at first. Then: "Just until the perimeter defenses are established." Then she stopped making excuses.

The truth came out one evening, three weeks after the battle. She and Theron sat in the reconstructed study, going over security plans. She'd been quiet all day—the kind of quiet that meant she was working something out. Her fingers brushed her locket once, then stilled as she gathered her thoughts.

"Can't go back," she said finally.

Theron looked up from the maps. "To what?"

"Mercenary work. Contract hunting. Moving town to town taking coin for kills." She traced the edge of the table with one finger. "Six months tracking leads. Following rumors. Bribing informants. Six months of zero results. No kingdom sent soldiers. No guild sent wizards. Everyone knew about the Witch of Thornhollow. Everyone looked the other way."

Her jaw tightened. "Had to hire myself to my own damn rescue mission. Pay Tomren with coin I didn't have. Risk everything because no one else would."

"You saved her," Theron said, choosing his words carefully.

"*We* saved her. And you know what that taught me?" Sera leaned forward, intensity burning in her eyes. "System doesn't work. People disappear. No one comes. Want protection? Build it yourself."

She gestured at the castle around them. "This place? Not just about teaching magic. About creating something that *responds*. Next witch rises, next demon cult takes root, next village screams for help—we'll hear them. We'll come."

"Is that why you're drilling the guards so hard?"

A fierce smile. "Building a response team, Theron. Small. But ours. People who know what it costs to lose someone. Who'll never look the other way."

She commanded the Institute's guard now—a mix of former soldiers, reformed cultists seeking redemption, and locals who wanted to protect what was being built. Tomren served as her second, his crossbow now mounted above the barracks door, a symbol of the battle that started everything.

During morning drills, Sera moved through the courtyard with tactical precision—eyes tracking exits, blind spots, defensive positions. The habit never left. But her shoulders would roll occasionally, releasing tension that no longer came from immediate threat. Her hand adjusted her sword belt—once, twice—not from nerves, but from the simple comfort of knowing it was there.

But on quiet nights, Theron still found her in Elina's room, watching her daughter sleep. Making sure she was real. Making sure she was breathing. Her hand would drift to her locket—the familiar weight of it—then drop away. The gesture was quieter now, less frantic. Not panic. Just... remembering.

---

**Tomren** found something he didn't expect: purpose beyond a debt.

For fifteen years, he'd followed Sera because he owed her his life. It was simple, clean—a soldier's oath, a life for a life. When they rescued Elina, when the witch fell, he'd expected that to be the end. Debt paid. Contract fulfilled.

"You're free to go," Sera told him, a week after the battle. "Release you from the oath. Don't owe me anything anymore."

He'd looked at her like she was speaking a foreign language.

"Where exactly would I go?"

"Anywhere. Home. Another company. Retirement." She'd smiled, trying to make it light. "Earned it."

"Home burned fifteen years ago. No other company to speak of. And retirement sounds boring as hell." He'd crossed his arms, stubborn as always. "You released me from the *debt*. Can't release me from giving a damn."

Now he trained the new guards—many of them younger than Elina, farm boys and merchant daughters who wanted to protect their homes. He was patient in a way that surprised him, firm but fair. The crossbow above the barracks door wasn't his anymore—he had a new one, better balanced, with sights he calibrated himself.

He maintained it every evening, the familiar *click-click-click* of the mechanism a soothing rhythm. Sometimes he hummed while he worked—old marching songs from campaigns he barely remembered. His positioning was still protective, still tactical, but now it came from choice rather than debt. He'd stand by the gate during student arrivals, or near Elina's window during her lessons, not hovering but *present*.

But the old one stayed up there. A reminder of the day he decided to *choose* his purpose instead of just fulfilling an obligation.

Some nights he joined Sera on her vigil outside Elina's room. Not speaking, just standing guard. The debt was paid. But the *duty* remained. Not because he had to.

Because he wanted to.

---

**Elina** studied magic.

She had talent—raw, untrained, but *real*. The witch kept her for a reason, Theron realized. Her blood carried something ancient, something resonant with old magic. Morganna could sense it, taste it in the ritual preparations. Planned to harvest that potential, to feed it to Szeth-Kaan as bait for a proper host.

Instead, it would be nurtured.

But recovery wasn't linear.

Some days Elina was the brilliant, sharp-tongued girl who bargained with a wizard while half-conscious. She asked cutting questions, challenged his teaching, laughed at Whisper's jokes, her eyes bright and engaged. She was fearless in the laboratory, cautious but curious, hands steady as she measured components, voice clear as she recited incantations.

Other days she couldn't leave her room. Couldn't stand anyone touching her, flinching away from even gentle hands. Flinched at shadows in doorways, breath catching, fingers trembling. Sera sat with her on those days, not speaking, just *present*, back against the wall where Elina could see her, close enough to reach but not touching. Sometimes Elina talked about the six months—the cold stone against her skin, the ritual marks being carved with needles that burned, the witch's voice promising it would be over soon, would stop hurting soon, just a little more. Sometimes she just stared at the wall, rocking slightly, humming that tuneless melody she used to keep herself sane, the sound thin and fragile in the quiet room.

"Does it get better?" she asked Theron once, after a particularly bad night.

He thought about lying. About offering false comfort.

"Let me think..." He paused, rubbing his thumb against his fingers. "Yes. But not in a straight line—recovery follows more of a... a spiral pattern. And not all the way. Some scars don't fade. The psychological literature on trauma suggests—" He stopped himself. "Sorry. Yes. It gets better. But slowly."

She nodded, like she'd expected that answer. Like she'd needed the truth more than the comfort.

"Good. I don't want to forget. I just want it to stop *defining* me."

She called him "Master" sometimes, which he hated. He told her to use his name. She grinned and did it anyway. On good days, it was teasing. On bad days, it was armor—formality keeping the world at a safe distance.

When Theron taught her, his thumb would rub against his fingers as he considered her questions. "*Good question*," he'd say, reaching for his component pouch to demonstrate a principle. "Let me think about how to explain this... the key principle is to *question everything*. That's how you stay safe—through constant verification and skepticism. Does that make sense?" The pouch was always full now—sulfur, copper wire, quicksilver, bat guano—everything organized and ready. Not the desperate scraps of a wizard escaping a dungeon, but the careful preparation of a teacher who knew the cost of being caught unprepared.

She was seventeen now. Too young to have survived what she did. Too old to pretend it didn't happen.

---

**The Thralls**—those who could be saved—recovered slowly. The witch's hold was magical, not physical, and with her death, it began to fade. Some regained themselves within days. Others took weeks. A few...

A few would never fully return. But they were cared for, given purpose, treated with dignity. The hollow-eyed man from the tower tended the gardens now. He didn't speak, but he *smiled* sometimes, when the flowers bloomed.

---

**Whisper** remained.

He had his own quarters—a converted dovecote with soft bedding, a private cheese supply, and a window overlooking the valley. He advised, he taught, he occasionally insulted visiting dignitaries with centuries-old wit.

But mostly, he stayed close to him.

"You could leave," Theron told him once. "The contract doesn't bind you anymore. You're free. If you wanted to go—"

Whisper looked at him with those ancient, knowing eyes.

"I *am* free," he said. "Free to choose. And I choose *this*. I choose *you*."

He'd never mentioned cheese since. Theron brought it anyway.

---

**Theron** didn't sleep well.

The others thought he was working late—and he was, often. But the real reason he stayed up, reading by candlelight in the converted study, the flame guttering and wavering as hours passed, was simpler: he was afraid of the dreams.

Morganna's memories didn't fade when he absorbed her power. They *integrated*. He remembered things he never experienced—the smell of smoke as she burned, acrid and choking; the faces of the seven friends who betrayed her, their laughter echoing; the first time she tasted human life force and felt the addictive rush of stolen years, like lightning in her veins. The memories felt like his own. Tasted like his own. That was the horrifying part.

He remembered murdering those friends. Felt the satisfaction of their terror, their pleading, their suffering. The righteousness of her revenge burning bright and clean. And some nights, some *awful* nights, he understood it. Agreed with it. Felt his hands itching to reach for that power again, to *use* it, to make someone else suffer the way he'd suffered—

"Still awake?" Whisper asked one night, appearing silently in the study, a shadow moving through shadows.

"Can't sleep. It's been three hours now. Maybe four." His voice was rough, tired. His eyes burned from staring at parchment by candlelight.

"Her memories?"

Theron nodded, not trusting his voice. His hands trembled slightly, resting on the desk.

Whisper settled on the desk, ancient eyes reflecting candlelight. "The fact that you're *afraid* of becoming like her is proof you won't. She never questioned herself. Never doubted. Never saw her reflection and felt horror at what she'd become."

"I have her *power*, Whisper. Every day I can feel it—centuries of stolen life, compressed into me. Sometimes I cast a simple spell and the output efficiency is... it's like I'm twenty wizards at once. The temptation to use it, to *really* use it, to test the upper limits of what's theoretically possible—"

"Is why you established rules for yourself," Whisper interrupted. "Why you require oversight from Maren and Sera on any major working. Why you teach others so you're never the only one holding knowledge. Why you refuse to make the same mistakes she did."

"What if—let me think—what if it's not enough? What if the protocols fail?"

"Then your friends will stop you. That's what they're *for*." Whisper's voice softened. "You're not alone in a dungeon, Theron. You're surrounded by people who care whether you live or die, who'll call you out if you cross a line. She isolated herself. You're building a *community*. That's the difference."

Theron still didn't sleep well. But he slept better than he did that first month, when every dream was fire and betrayal and the seductive pull of dark magic.

The absorbed power was a tool, he reminded himself. Dangerous, like any tool. But tools could *build*.

As long as he never forgot what it cost.

---

**The Future:**

Word spread. Slowly at first, then faster.

A place where knowledge was shared, not hoarded. Where wizards and herbalists and scientists worked together instead of in jealous isolation. Where the dark history of Thornhollow was studied so it could never be repeated.

They came from everywhere—the curious, the brilliant, the broken, the hopeful. He turned no one away, though he watched carefully. Power corrupted. He knew that better than anyone now.

In the lecture hall, Theron taught with his thumb rubbing against his fingers as he explained complex theory. "Let me think... *transmutation requires balance*," he'd say, the gesture punctuating his words. "The fundamental principle being that energy cannot be created or destroyed—only transformed. Does that make sense? Any questions on the theoretical framework?" His hand would check his component pouch between demonstrations, an unconscious reassurance that everything he needed was there. Full. Ready. No longer scraping together scraps in desperation.

But power also *built*. Created. Protected.

It wasn't perfect. Nothing built from ruins ever was.

Two apprentices had to be expelled for attempting forbidden rituals in the old dungeons. Three families pulled their children out after learning the Institute's director was a "dark wizard who murdered the Witch." A merchant guild in Millhaven refused to trade with them, claiming they were "dabbling in evil."

Sera handled the security responses—always positioning herself between the threat and the students, her hand adjusting her sword belt in that familiar way. Not nervousness. Readiness. The tactical assessment never stopped, but it no longer consumed her.

Funding was precarious. The salvaged gold from Morganna's hoard helped, but it wouldn't last forever. They needed patrons, donors, support from kingdoms that still viewed Thornhollow with suspicion.

Some of the reformed cultists relapsed. One fled in the night, stealing supplies. Another tried to continue the witch's work in secret until Sera's guards caught him. Trust was hard to build and easy to shatter.

Tomren had been on duty that night—positioned at his usual overlook, crossbow within reach, humming to himself while he watched the grounds. The *click* of his maintenance work had stopped the moment he spotted movement. Old habits, new purpose.

And the nightmares weren't just Theron's. Half the residents woke screaming some nights. The thralls who recovered carried scars that didn't show on skin. Elina wasn't the only one who had bad days.

But they kept building anyway.

Because the alternative—giving up, walking away, letting Thornhollow return to being a cursed name whispered in fear—was worse.

Theron stood at his study window, morning light warm on his face, watching a new group of students arrive through the gates. Young faces, eager faces, full of potential they didn't yet understand. Voices carrying up from the courtyard—excited, nervous, hopeful. The smell of bread drifted from the kitchens. Someone was singing in the greenhouse. The sound of hammers from the expansion construction echoed off stone.

Below in the courtyard, Sera assessed the new arrivals with trained eyes—scanning for threats that weren't there, hand resting near her sword hilt out of habit, positioning herself near the gate where she could see all approaches. Her shoulders rolled once—settling weight, releasing tension. Tomren stood at his usual post, crossbow maintenance tools at his belt, the familiar *click-click* of the mechanism carrying faintly, humming something tuneless as he observed the crowd. His positioning was protective, angled to cover Sera's back without hovering.

Theron's fingers found his component pouch again—*full*, always full now, the weight of it comforting and familiar—and he allowed himself a small moment of gratitude. Not for the power he'd absorbed. For the peace to use it *carefully*. For friends who would stop him if he went too far. For a purpose beyond survival.

Whisper settled on his shoulder, warm weight, familiar presence.

"Nervous?"

"Always. With this many new variables, the probability of—"

"Good. Complacency is how witches are made."

Theron smiled, touching the spellbook at his chest—warm leather against his palm, Lucian's legacy, now his to honor and continue.

"Then let's make sure we do better. Much better."

The morning sun continued to rise over Thornhollow, light chasing away shadows, warming stone that had been cold for too long. Below, the students passed through the gates, beginning their journey toward knowledge tempered with wisdom, power balanced with responsibility.

And above them all, carved in stone where everyone could see: *No one is forgotten. No one is alone.*

**THE END**
