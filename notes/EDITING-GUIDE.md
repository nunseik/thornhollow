## Emotional Beat Checklist

Ensure these moments exist and have weight:

- [ ] Theron's despair in cell (Prologue)
- [ ] Moment of doubt about trusting Sera/Tomren
- [ ] Sera's vulnerability about Elina
- [ ] Tomren's reveal of his motivation
- [ ] Group oath before castle assault

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't:

- ❌ Gloss over trauma and consequences
- ❌ Make victory too clean or easy
- ❌ Forget about introduced plot elements
- ❌ Skip emotional payoffs (especially rescue)
- ❌ Have epilogue be perfectly happy with no struggles

### Do:
- ✅ Build trust gradually through shared danger
- ✅ Give antagonist understandable (if not justifiable) motivation
- ✅ Show psychological and physical costs
- ✅ Make victory bittersweet and earned
- ✅ Resolve or remove all Chekhov's guns
- ✅ Give emotional scenes proper space
- ✅ Show ongoing recovery and complexity

---

## Pacing Notes

### Current Pacing Issues
1. **Too Fast:** Chapter 2 (meeting), Chapter 11 (rescue)
2. **Too Thin:** Chapter 6 (pre-battle), Chapter 8 (revelations)
3. **Just Right:** Chapter 1 (escape), Chapter 9 (trap)

### Target Pacing
- **Prologue-Chapter 1:** Quick (hook reader)
- **Chapters 2-5:** Moderate (build characters and plan)
- **Chapter 6:** Slow (calm before storm, character depth)
- **Chapters 7-11:** Variable (tension rises, big climax)
- **Epilogue:** Moderate (reflection and hope)

---

## Tone Consistency

Each section should have consistent tone:

**Prologue-Chapter 1:** Tense, clever, hopeful escape
- Genre: Prison break, wit over force

**Chapters 2-6:** Strategic thriller with character drama
- Genre: Planning/heist, team formation, quest

**Chapters 7-10:** Dark fantasy, horror elements, action
- Genre: Infiltration, supernatural horror, battle

**Chapter 11:** Intense climax, moral complexity, emotion
- Genre: Dark fantasy, psychological, emotional payoff

**Epilogue:** Hopeful with realistic complexity
- Genre: Recovery, rebuilding, bittersweet victory

---
