# NOTES & REMINDERS

## What's Working Well ✅
- Whisper's characterization (keep exactly as is)
- Morganna's backstory and complexity
- Sera/Elina relationship depth
- Group bonding in Chapter 6
- Power absorption scene (Chapter 11)

## What Needs Enhancement ⚠️
- Physical descriptions for all main characters (minimal currently)
- Distinctive speech patterns (especially Theron and Tomren)
- Theron's physical mannerisms/tics
- Sera's tactical/military voice
- Tomren's personality beyond "quiet and loyal"
- More Theron ↔ Tomren interaction

## Implementation Guidelines
1. **Add descriptions naturally** - weave into action, not info-dumps
2. **Show habits consistently** - if it's a habit, it appears multiple times
3. **Speech patterns throughout** - every dialogue should sound like that character
4. **Emotional truth** - reactions must match established character
5. **Track as you go** - update this document when traits are added to chapters
