## Next Steps

### If you want to start editing:

1. **Read** [notes/EDITING-GUIDE.md](notes/EDITING-GUIDE.md) first
   - Provides complete roadmap for revisions
   - Prioritizes changes by importance
   - Includes checklists and time estimates

2. **Focus on the "Big Five" critical changes:**
   - Theron's backstory and connection to witch
   - Sera/Tomren trust-building (Chapter 2)
   - Witch's full story (Chapter 8)
   - Elina's rescue scene (Chapter 11)
   - Power absorption trauma (Chapter 11)

3. **Use the detailed guides:**
   - [CHARACTER-NOTES.md](notes/CHARACTER-NOTES.md) - What each character needs
   - [SCENE-NOTES.md](notes/SCENE-NOTES.md) - How to expand each chapter
   - [UNUSED-ELEMENTS.md](notes/UNUSED-ELEMENTS.md) - Plot threads to resolve

### Working with the files:

**Option A: Edit chapter files directly**
- Work in [chapters/](chapters/) directory
- Each chapter is a separate file
- Easy to focus on one section at a time

**Option B: Edit the complete draft**
- Work in [draft.md](draft.md)
- Has everything in one place
- Re-split into chapters when done if desired

**Option C: Create new files**
- Keep originals as reference
- Create `revised/` directory
- Work on clean copies

## Key Decisions Needed

Before extensive editing, decide:

1. **Theron's connection to the witch** - What's their history?
2. **Witch's name and motivation** - Why does she do what she does?
3. **Sera & Tomren relationship** - Romantic? Friends? Family?
4. **Split Chapter 11?** - It's very long; consider making it two chapters

See the "Questions to Answer" section in [EDITING-GUIDE.md](notes/EDITING-GUIDE.md) for details.

## Current Stats

- **Total word count:** ~22,000 words (novella length)
- **Target word count:** ~35,000-45,000 words (short novel)
- **Number of chapters:** 11 + Prologue + Epilogue
- **Estimated editing time:** 20-30 hours (critical changes only) or 45-65 hours (complete revision)

## What's Complete

✅ Technical conversion (POV, mechanics removal)
✅ File organization and structure
✅ Comprehensive editing guides created

## What Needs Work

## Notes

- **Whisper stays as-is!** His witty, ancient rat personality is perfect.
- The story structure is solid; it's the depth that needs adding.
- Focus on emotional beats and character motivation.
- The bones are good—now add flesh and heart.
